90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of folios 1-10 of a majmūʿa manuscript 
    in Hebrew letters from the Geniza in the Firkovitch collection in Saint Petersburg.
    The beginning and end of the text are preserved in the manuscript, 
    but there is an extensive lacuna between folios 4 and 5.
    The text was extracted from an xml version of
    Jewish-Muslim Intellectual History Entangled. Textual Materials from the Firkovitch
    Collection, Saint Petersburg, edited by Camilla Adang, Bruno Chiesa,
    Omar Hamdan, Wilferd Madelung, Sabine Schmidtke and Jan Thiele, 
    Open Book Publishers 2020, pp. 295-316 (see pp. 38-41 for an introduction).
    The pagination of the print version was not represented in the xml file;
    the pagination of the manuscript (National Library of Russia, YA I 3951) 
    is used instead.
