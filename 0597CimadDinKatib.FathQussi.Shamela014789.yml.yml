90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text scraped from Shamela by Peter with automatic conversion of headers. Checked by Gowaart. The edition on which the digital text is based seems to be a modern reprint of the 1888 Carlo de Landberg edition (close comparison would however be necessary to establish the relationship more certainly) which remains the standard edition for researchers.
