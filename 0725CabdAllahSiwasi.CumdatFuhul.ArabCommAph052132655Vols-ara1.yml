90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text provided by the ERC-funded project 
    "Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms"
    (2012-2017; PI: Peter Pormann, University of Manchester).
    Converted from TEI XML by PV.
    Cleaning of the structural annotation by PV
    (without access to (scans of) the original manuscripts).
    Folio numbers of the different witnesses were
    converted to OpenITI mARkdown page numbers.
    NB: the XML versions of these maqālas (except maqālas 1 and 7)
    have many problems, especially in footnotes and page numbers,
    but also the text itself seems not up to date with the PDF and rtf versions.
    In maqāla 3, occasional page numbers in the original xml file
    refer to an otherwise not mentioned witness V3;
    PV took this to be a mistake for V4 and converted the page numbers accordingly.
    In maqāla 2, there is only one page number in the original XML, 
    which refers to witness E5 (while the TEI header states the only witness
    for this maqāla is V4). PV converted this page number to PageV00P143B.
    PV replaced the xml version of maqāla 2, which seemed especially bad,
    with a version based on the RTF text. Consider doing this for
    all maqālas (except perhaps 1 and 7?).
