90#BOOK#COMMENT##: This text, extant in a single manuscript 
    (ms. Ḥaddād, now in the Sami I. Haddad Memorial Library),
    was until recently considered (a part of an) Arabic 
    translation of a no longer extant Greek commentary by Palladios
    on Hippocrates' aphorisms. Recent research has shown that 
    the author of the Arabic text did not base himself on a Greek
    text but on an early Arabic translation of the Aphorisms,
    and an(other) Arabic translation of Palladios' commentary
    (Peter Pormann et al., "The Enigma of Arabic and Hebrew Palladius",
    Intellectual History of the Islamicate World 5 (2017), 252-310.
