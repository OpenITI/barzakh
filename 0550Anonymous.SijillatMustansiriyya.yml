90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A collection of letters ascribed to the Fāṭimid caliph al-Mustanṣir.
    The date of the most recent letter is 479 AH; there is discussion about the
    date when the letters were compiled into a collection, this possibly happened
    as early as in the 6th century AH, even though the manuscript dates from 
    about 1300 AH.
