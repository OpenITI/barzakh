90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was digitised with Google OCR and corrected by Gowaart. I have followed the edition's lack of consistently noting the hamza and using a generic ha instead of ta marbuta. The edition of the text is somewhat complicated, it interlaces the poem included here with a 19th century anonymous mukhtasar (see Salibi, "Maronite Historians of Medieval Lebanon", p. 39) as well as a commentary by the editor. For OpenITI purposes I felt it was best to separate these three layers, and assign separate URIs to the poem and the mukhtasar, while deleting the editorial commentary. I have also deleted the titles, as these seem to be part of the commentary rather than the poem. As a result the pagination looks like the text has gaps, but this is entirely due to my reorganisation of the texts. 
 The poem is a zajaliyya in Lebanese colloquial. This poetic form is in quatrains, as opposed to the usual Arabic two hemistiches. Currently mARkdown does not accommodate this form (in which the first three hemistiches rhyme with one another, while the last rhymes with the endrhyme of each other quatrain in the poem), so I have followed some other editors of some texts by splitting the quatrain in two parts. This way it looks identical to other Arabic poetry, except that the endrhyme only happens every two lines.
