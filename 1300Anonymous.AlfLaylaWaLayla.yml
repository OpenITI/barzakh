90#BOOK#COMMENT##: This is the text of the (first) Bulaq edition of the
    1001 Nights; which is the product of what Muhsin Mahdi calls
    the "Late Egyptian Branch" of the tradition. It was fabricated in the
    mid-18th century by an Egyptian scribe in response to the request for
    a complete version of the text (until then, no manuscripts contained
    1001 nights). See Muhsin Mahdi, The Thousand and One Nights
    From the Earliest Arabic Sources, Leiden: Brill, 1984 (vol. 1,
    Arabic introduction, p. 17-20).
