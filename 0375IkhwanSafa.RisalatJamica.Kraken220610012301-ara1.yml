90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * Kraken version: 3.0.0.0b21.dev6
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: 12-24-2021_ArabPersGeneralized.mlmodel
    Corrected by Gowaart: footnotes deleted, some typos corrected, structure
    annotated.
    Here and there a line was missing. I have typed them when I came across them,
    but there may be more. Pagination follows the PDF page numbering, not that of
    the book.
    Image on p.  not reproduced + secret alphabet and examples on vol. 1 pp. 548-9
    also not rendered.
    One page missing in PDF vol. 1 between 641 and 642.
    The text contained many footnote markers, most of which have been deleted, but
    not all.
