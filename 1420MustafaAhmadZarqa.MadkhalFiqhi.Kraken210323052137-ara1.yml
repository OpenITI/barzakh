90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: arabPers-WithDiffTypefaces.mlmodel۔
    NB: the 2004, 3rd edition, is not listed on worldcat, only the 1998 edition.
    Pagination is -1.
    There are some English and French passages, book references, etc.
    Due to the OCR model, these are rendered as number strings.
    Due to other numbers (e.g., footnotes), these have largely been left in place.
    Qawāʿid are introduced in a variety of ways, unfortunately, many are just types in bold.
    They are focused in the third part, which is dedicated to qawāʿid.
