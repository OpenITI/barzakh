90#BOOK#COMMENT##: This text was published in a collection of 
    seven short texts attributed to al-Nasā'ī.
    The title is probably a modern one, created by the editor Jamīl ʿAlī Ḥasan;
    the text does not have a title in the Zāyid edition.
    There are multiple versions of this collection in the corpus, 
    based on three editions: 
    * published with al-Bukhārī's Kitāb al-Ḍuʿafā'
      and al-Nasā'ī's al-Ḍuʿafā' wa-al-matrūkīn, ed. Maḥmūd Ibrāhīm Zāyid:
      - Ḥalab (Dār al-Waʿy) 1396, pp. 118-129. (JK000510, Shamela0005839)
      - Beirut (Dār al-Maʿrifa) 1406, pp. 259-275. (Shia003077, JK011235)
    * (Majmūʿat) Rasā'il fī ʿulūm al-ḥadīth, ed. Jamīl ʿAlī Ḥasan, 
      Beirut 1405/1985, pp. 55-59
      (Shia001971, Shamela006004, JK00697)
    Only the Zāyid 1406 edition is currently available in PDF format.
    Zāyid does not mention the manuscript he bases its text on, 
    but it is likely a manuscript that also contains al-Nasā'ī's
    Kitāb al-Ḍuʿafā' wa-al-matrūkīn: 
    see 0303Nasai.AsilaFiRijal.Shia003077BK1-ara1.yml.
    The Zāyid editions have the texts in a different order 
    from the Ḥasan ed.:
    | title                             | Zāyid | Ḥasan |
    |-----------------------------------|-------|-------|
    | Tasmiyat man lam yarwi            | 1     | 3     |
    | Man ḥaddatha ʿanhu Ibn Abī ʿArūba | 2     | 4     |
    | As'ila li-al-Nasā'ī fī al-rijāl   | 3     | 7     |
    | Tasmiyat ... asḥāb Abī Ḥanīfa     | 4     | 6     |
    | Aḥsan al-asānīd ...               | 5     | 5     |
    | Tasmiyat Fuqahā' al-amṣār         | 6     | 1     |
    | al-Ṭabaqāt                        | 7     | 2     |
    The collections have been split into their constituent parts.
    The title of the text is probably a modern one, created by the editor Jamīl ʿAlī Ḥasan;
    the text does not have a title in the Zāyid edition.
