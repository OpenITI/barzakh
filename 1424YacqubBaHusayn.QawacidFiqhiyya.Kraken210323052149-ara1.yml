90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken۔ Page 110, 112, 146, 180 onwards missing.
    Missing pages, except 110,112, which could not be successfully OCR'd,
    replaced with updated OCR. As this is a modern texts all material was left in place,
    inc. footnotes. Generally the OCR was very good, although still required some fixes
    and re-building of interpolated lines.
    Qāʿida's are referred to in a number of ways,
    but there are significant numbers in separate, numbered sections.
