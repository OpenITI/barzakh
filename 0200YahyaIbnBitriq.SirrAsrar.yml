90#BOOK#COMMENT##: The work exists in a number of recensions:
    * the Long Form (LF) was edited by ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī. 
      "An English translation of the Long Form Arabic text was 
      prepared by Ismaʿīl ʿAlī and is included in Robert Steele’s 
      edition of the Latin edition prepared by Roger Bacon.
      However, the base text for this was Gotha, GRL, MS Or.Arab.1869;
      in places it varies significantly from the Arabic text of the 
      Badawi edition and cannot be used as a direct translation." 
      (Neelam Hussain, Appendix 1, p. 402)
    * the Short Form, in 8 maqālas (SF8), exists in a number of manuscripts
      (Paris BnF MS Arabe 2421, Leiden Universiteitsbibliotheek MS Or. 749)
      and was edited by Neelam Hussain.
