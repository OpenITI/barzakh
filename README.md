This is a repository for texts to be integrated into OpenITI

Please paste your file in this folder, giving it the proposed URI as filename. 

A script will later move your file to its designated location in the corpus, creating the necessary folders and (empty) yml files in the process.

You can already create a yml file for your added author, text or version in this folder (make sure to follow the naming conventions for yml files).
