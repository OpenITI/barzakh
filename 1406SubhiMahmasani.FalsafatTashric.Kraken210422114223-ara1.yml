    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: arabPers-WithDiffTypefaces.mlmodel.
    This text had a lot of spacing errors (perhaps because source file is photos, not flat scans);
    I have attempted to correct as far as possible through automated fixes via Regex.
    Failed pages: 27-29;32;36; 44 (last paragraph);46;54; 56-58; 64-5; 106; 172; 186; 188; 207-8; 244; 310-11; 315.
    I can see no formula on how qawāʿid are quoted (not sure if they are very frequent either).
    Pagination is -1.
