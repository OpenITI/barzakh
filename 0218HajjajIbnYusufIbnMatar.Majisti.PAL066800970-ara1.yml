90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of the Leiden ms. (Or. 680)
    of al-Ḥajjāj's translation of the Almagest by Josep Casulleras
    (https://ptolemaeus.badw.de/team/9). 
    Text digitized by the Ptolemaeus Arabus et Latinus project at the
    Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften.
    Both transliteration and photographs are available on the link above.
    The text was converted to OpenITI mARkdown by PV.
    New lines in the manuscript are indicated in the transcription with `//`
    The manuscript uses circles to divide sections; 
    these were transcribed in the transcription with
    ❊ (`U+274A : EIGHT TEARDROP-SPOKED PROPELLER ASTERISK`;
    cannot be rendered in many fonts). 
    PV has kept these characters in the mARkdown version, 
    but they could perhaps better be replaced by paragraph marks `# `.
    Arabic characters representing a number 
    (or points on a line in geometrical explanations)
    are overlined in the manuscript
    and tagged as `<u class="num">` in the transliteration; 
    PV has tagged these characters with a `@NUM@` tag.
