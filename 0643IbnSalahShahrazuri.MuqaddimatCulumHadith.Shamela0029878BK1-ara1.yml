90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a digital text of Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's Muqaddima. 
    In the print edition, Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text was printed 
    together with a commentary by al-Bulqīnī: Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text
    at the top of the page, and al-Bulqīnī's at the bottom.
    Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text contains 65 anwāʿ, 
    and at the end of the text, al-Bulqīnī adds four additional anwāʿ.
    The digital text contained only Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text
    and al-Bulqīnī's four additional anwāʿ, not al-Bulqīnī's
    comments to Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text.
    PV split off al-Bulqīnī's additional anwāʿ from Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ's text. 
    PV corrected the structural tagging and removed the lines
    that contained only dots to indicate that the current page
    contains only text by al-Bulqīnī, not text by Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ.
