90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken: I have cleaned the footnotes mostly and tagged most of the file (july 2021). Pages  207, 294, 299 were missing. Gowaart scanned and cleaned them and I have inserted them in the file. Thus, this digital text is complete, but the PDF file floating around has missing pages.
