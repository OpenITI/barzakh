90#BOOK#COMMENT##: An astronomical work, "compiled in Ṣanʿā’, Yemen during the rule of the Zaydī imam al-Manṣūr bi-Allāh Ḥusayn ibn al-Qāsim" (http://www.filaha.org/almanac_yusuf_al_mahalli.html). "The introduction is mainly a justification for studying astronomy (...) the first six pages focus on judicial astrology (aḥkām) (...). This is followed by a two page chart of what is beneficial in diet and health for each season of the year. This is standard seasonal lore not directly related to Yemen. Next are several page charts, including an illustration of a lunar eclipse forecast for the month of Dhū al-Ḥijja in 1145 A.H., a discussion of the visibility of Sirius (al-shiʿrā) in Yemen and what that portends for the year, lucky and unlucky star positions, and the movement of the sun. The last part of the text (ff. 10b-22b) is an almanac chart (...). The almanac chart is constructed day by day on the basis of the Seleucid Christian solar calendar, starting with the vernal equinox. (...) Information in the almanac tables is contained in charts (folios 10b-22b), with each folio spread containing 28 columns.  The contents of these columns, from right to left, are summarized below as given along the top of the first chart:
    1.  aḥkām al-mamāzijāt:  this section is written as a single column containing generic predictions about events during the zodiacal month. 
    2.  tawqīʿāt:  This section records specific data about the seasons, calendrical correlations, agricultural activities and the like, as edited and translated below.
    3.  asāmī ayyām al-usbūʿ:  Arabic names of the days of the week
    4.  al-ʿadad min Shawwāl sannat 1145:  numbers of the days in the Hijri month of Shawwāl in 1145 A.H.
    5.  al-ʿadad min Baramhāt sannat 1449:  numbers of the days in the month of Baramhāt in 1449 of the Coptic calendar.
    6.  al-ʿadad min Ādhār Rūmī sannat 2044:  numbers of the days in the month of Ādhār in 2044 of the Seleucid Christian solar calendar.
    7.  al-ʿadad min Shahrīwarmāh sannat 1102:  numbers of the days in the month of Shahrīwarmāh in 1102 of the Yazdigard reckoning of the Persian calendar.
    8-15.  ḥarakāt al-kawākib fī al-burūj:  star movements in the zodiacal houses.
    16.  ḍill al-zawāl aqdām wa-daqā’iq:  noon shadow length in feet and minutes.
    17.  asāmī ayyām al-usbūʿ: Arabic names of the days of the week, repeated here because it is the first column of a new page.
    18.  al-ʿadad min Shawwāl: numbers of the days in the Hijri month of Shawwāl
    19.  manāzil al-qamar:  stations of the moon (for each day).
    20.  burūj al-qamar:  zodiacal houses of the moon (for each day).
    21-26.  ittiṣāl al-qamar bi-al-kawākib:  conjunction of the moon with moving stars or planets.
    27.  al-mumāzzajāt: mixed fortunes
    28.  al-ikhtiyārāt al-qamarīya: recommended acts based on the moon." (http://www.filaha.org/almanac_yusuf_al_mahalli.html#Text)
