90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCR on eScriptorium from a scan made by me. The text exists in a single known manuscript, but only the first two of its fifty chapters have been edited. I have digitised these two chapters, and hope to digitise the remainder of the manuscript once I get a copy of it. The edition has a German translation on facing pages to the ones containing the Arabic edition, hence why the text seems to skip pages. I closely corrected the first four pages but not the remaining ones as the OCR quality was high with only few mistakes. I did delete all the footnote markers and annotate the text. The titles of the remaining 48 chapters I have taken from the catalogue description of the manuscript from the Khuda Bakhsh catalogue (see collated, MS no. 2661, though I used the digitised version on the website of the library).
