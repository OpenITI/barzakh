90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text file contains parts of the Kitāb al-Awrāq that
    are absent from the published editions, edited by Hilāl Nājī (d. 1432/2011)
    from a manuscript in the library of al-Azhar in Cairo 
    (number 847 khāṣṣ, 7083 Abāẓa-Adab), covering the years 295-315AH.
    Nājī writes (introduction p. 12) that he had edited the years 316-318 AH 
    from the same manuscript in a publication titled "Qiṭʿa nādira min Awrāq al-Ṣūlī" 
    ["Qiṭʿa nādira min Kitāb al-Awrāq li-Abī Bakr al-Ṣūlī. Ṣafḥa majhūla min tārīḫ al-ʿIrāq",
    published in 1990 in Baghdād; perhaps also published as 
    "Qiṭʿa lam tunshar min Kitāb al-Awrāq li-al-Ṣūlī", 
    in Dirāsāt Sharqiyya/Etudes Orientales 1990/5-6, Paris].
