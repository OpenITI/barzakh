90#VERS#COMMENT##: pre-print text provided by Yossef Rapoport,
    who edited and translated the text together with Emilie Savage-Smith. 
    The edition is mostly based on the recently aquired manuscript of
    the Bodleian library in Oxford (Bodleian ms. Arab C. 90). 
    The last pages of the text (pp. 276ff.) are not present in that manuscript 
    and are presented here based on two other manuscripts: 
    * D (Damascus, Maktabat al-Assad al-Waṭaniyya MS 16501, fols. 1a-201b) 
    * G (Gotha, Ms. Orient. A 2066, fols. 148a-164a).
    Other manuscripts used in the edition: 
    * B (Bodleian, ms. Or. 68, fols. 109b-144a)
    * C (Cairo, Dār al-Kutub MS mīqāt 876, fols. 1b-7b)
    * C-2 (Cairo, Dār al-Kutub, MS 1852 adab, fols. 70a-78a)
    * M (Milan, Abrosiana MS & 76 sup, fols. 2a-67b)
    PV converted the MS Word documents into mARkdown format,
    added the labels of the illustrations
    and added the page numbers from the printed edition into the text.
