90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text provided by the ERC-funded project 
    "Arabic Commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms"
    (2012-2017; PI: Peter Pormann, University of Manchester).
    Converted from TEI XML by PV.
    Cleaning of the structural annotation by PV
    (without access to (scans of) the original manuscripts).
    Folio numbers of the different witnesses were
    converted to OpenITI mARkdown page numbers.
    The text contains three sets of page numbers;
    one set (from the T4 witness) was converted into OpenITI mARkdown format;
    the other sets (it is unclear to which manuscript/edition these refer)
    are between single and double square brackets, respectively. 
    NB: Contains both Arabic and Hebrew script!
