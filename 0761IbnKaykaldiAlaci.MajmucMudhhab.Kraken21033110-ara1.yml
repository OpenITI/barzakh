    OCR had problems with beginning and ends of some lines, 
    which required a lot of manual correction (see tracking doc).
    Early in text, qawaids are generally in-text but introduced 
    by 'qāʿida' (w/o definite article) 
    or introduced with an ordinal number e.g., القاعدة الخامسة. 
    Later in the text they are in separate sections with 'qāʿida' headers
    (and annotated as individual headings);
    these are not always immediately followed by a qāʿida, however.
    Finally, the hierachy of sections of the text was not clear at all,
    so level headings are unlikely to be totally accurate w/o a closer reading.
    Pagination failed. There was a qawāʿid index but this has been removed;
    please refer to PDF edition.
