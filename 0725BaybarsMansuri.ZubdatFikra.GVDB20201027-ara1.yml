90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text has been digitised via Google OCR and annotated by Gowaart. The pdf was of good quality so the OCR is fairly reliable, but there are still many mistakes, some of which were corrected when I spotted them, but it would be a lot of work to go through the entire text. The text has been annotated with simplified mARkdown. Poetry and obituaries have been tagged. 
 This was until recently the only published volume of an originally 10-volume universal chronicle. It is the final volume of the chronicle, dealing with Mamluk history up until the author's time. Manuscripts of most of the other volumes have been preserved but not edited (but see below). The manuscripts on which the present edition was based have not been preserved in their entirety and are cut off in the year 709. The editor has added an appendix with material from these years quoted by the later historian 0855BadrDinCayni. I have not digitised this appendix, but it could be added later on if so desired.
 It seems that another part of the chronicle has also been published (dealing with the sixth and seventh century AH) by Umar Tadmuri (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/955672256), but I have not found a pdf of this. It appears that this is not based on the surviving manuscripts of the original chronicle, however, but on quotations by Ibn al-Furat and al-Yafici.
