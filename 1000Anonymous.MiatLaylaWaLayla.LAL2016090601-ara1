#META# Editorial declaration: LAL Arabic texts are based upon original manuscript research. For each text, a base manuscript is selected, and notable variants from other consulted manuscripts provided. Details of the manuscripts are provided in the source Desc; the first manuscript listed therein in the base. Arabic ḥarakāt other than shaddah are only provided for disambiguation of possible readings or for unusual words; however all shaddahs except those arising from the assimilation of the definite article are included. Orthography may be standardized to modern style.
#META# Editorial declaration: Texts are divided into numbered sections, which in the bilingual version are used to align the Arabic text with the English translation. The majority of manuscripts will not, of course, have been written with modern paragraph structures: the division of the text into such is for readability and to align with the translation, and is entirely the choice of the editor(s).
#META# Editorial declaration: The format of the Library of Arabic Literature volumes does not permit the full apparatus required for a critical edition. This is just as well, as works such as Miʾat laylah wa-laylah are not amenable to critical editions for two reasons. First, with their obscure and diverse origins, the possibility of reconstructing an archetype or original is extremely limited. Second, the variations that do occur in the stories may consist of entire episodes, so keeping track of them while maintaining a consistent narrative thread would be very difficult for both the editor and the eventual reader. The present work is thus an edition of a single version or recension of Miʾat laylah wa-laylah.
#META# Editorial declaration: I have occasionally inserted or substituted elements from the other manuscripts when the base manuscript أ is corrupt or insufficient. There are, however, a small number of notes in which I merely give the variant without changing the text. Manuscript أ is but one of several recensions of Miʾat laylah wa-laylah, and although it is preferable to the others on many accounts, it has no claim to be the most ancient, authentic, or authoritative version. As with Alf laylah, the absence of an archetype means that there exist a number of versions, all of which may be useful in determining the history of the collection and relationship between manuscripts, or in clarifying corrupt or missing passages.
#META# Editorial declaration: This text, like virtually all this kind of narrative, is written in what is known as Middle Arabic. The term does not usually refer to a chronological period (like Middle English) but rather to written forms of the language which are neither classical nor dialectal. Middle Arabic deviates from the accepted norms of the classical language but is ultimately based on it. It may contain dialectal features, but it is closer in its grammar, syntax, and vocabulary to the classical written Arabic. There is no single standard of Middle Arabic: the term covers a large variety of possible forms.
#META# Editorial declaration: In the past it was assumed that Middle Arabic was used primarily by those who lacked sufficient grasp of the classical language. While this is no doubt sometimes the case, we now have numerous examples of authors skilled in the classical norms writing in Middle Arabic. In fact, even “classical” texts as we know them probably contained far more deviations than we suspect. With the advent of printing and publishing, there has been a tendency for editors to “improve” or “correct” the language of manuscripts. The result has been almost certainly an exaggeration of the preponderance of the classical norms.
#META# Editorial declaration: Middle Arabic texts display two types of linguistic features distinct from those of the formal or classical language: those borrowed from a dialect, and those which are unique to Middle Arabic. An example of the latter would be the use of the intransitive verb naẓara (to gaze, look) for raʾā (to see), a usage that is neither classical nor dialectal. The proportions of the elements vary considerably, even with versions of the same work. Jérôme Lentin’s examination of manuscripts of the popular epic Sīrat al-Ẓāhir Baybars, for example, shows that the amount of dialectal material varies quite significantly, with some versions being much more literary, other much more dialectal, all the while recounting the same narrative with only stylistic differences. The popular sīrah are in general more dialectal than story collections, but it is also interesting to note that the Galland manuscript of Alf laylah, the oldest extant copy, contains a higher proportion of dialectal material than other story collections such as Miʾat laylah or al-Ḥikāyāt al-ʿajībah, and this fact is surely significant in determining the origins and history of these texts.
#META# Editorial declaration: In Miʾat laylah manuscripts, we find relatively few clearly dialectal features but a constant presence of Middle Arabic forms. Two of the manuscripts, A and AKM, have a much higher degree of Middle Arabic; high enough that the reader will legitimately question the scribes’ acquaintance with the rules of formal Arabic. Be that as it may, a study of the language of these written narratives should eventually lead to a typology or reveal valuable clues as to regional distribution, composition, and so forth. These studies are in a very early stage, and one of the reasons is the paucity of published sources. Lentin makes the plea not just for more published sources in Middle Arabic, but for the fidelity of edition to manuscript. He writes as a historian of the language, but the same should be said for literary scholars as well. The present edition, with its preservation or documentation of all the divergences from classical norms, will contribute to the study of both Middle Arabic and its literary sources.
#META# Editorial declaration: So to the uninitiated, it will appear that Manuscript أ contains a wealth of errors. In fact, almost all of these are attested Middle Arabic features, and there is nothing particularly surprising about them. What is surprising, though, is the spectacular quantity of these features. What follows is a list, making no claims to exhaustiveness, of the Middle Arabic features occurring in our text:
#META# Editorial declaration: Lack of verb-subject agreement (gender or number), and frequent emplacement of plural verb before a plural subject.
#META# Editorial declaration: Use of alif tanwīn for indefinite nouns regardless of case.
#META# Editorial declaration: Absence of the jussive mode, (e.g., لم يشتري).
#META# Editorial declaration: Absence of hamzah or its replacement with yāʾ (e.g., سايل for سائل). When hamzah does occur, it is usually written without support (e.g., رءا for رأى) or with a ي as in يسئل (for يسأل).).
#META# Editorial declaration: Confusion of emphatic and non-emphatic consonants, as well as between ض and ظ (e.g., يستيقظ  يستيقض).
#META# Editorial declaration: Dhāl written as dāl, reflecting pronunciation (e.g., ذهب  دهب).
#META# Editorial declaration: Retention of final –n of sound plural ending (-ūn, -īn) even when in construct.
#META# Editorial declaration: Geminate verbs in first or second person conjugated like weak final verbs (e.g., افتضيت الابكار).
#META# Editorial declaration: Confusion of long and short vowels, (e.g., الاعرابي  الاعربي; لأجلِ  لاجلي).
#META# Editorial declaration: Tāʾ marbūtah written as tāʾ (e.g., الحياة  الحيات).
#META# Editorial declaration: Naẓara and taʾammala used in the sense of “to see” (raʾā).
#META# Editorial declaration: Use of certain plural forms, such as أطيار, فيسان.
#META# Editorial declaration: Misplaced prosthetic alif (e.g., يدعوا with singular subject).
#META# Editorial declaration: Rūḥ or ḥāl with personal pronoun suffix (rather than nafs) as reflexive object.
#META# Editorial declaration: Verb and preposition usage often differs from classical norms. For example, ilā for li- to indicate possession or غاب على instead of غاب عن. In the night divisions, Shahrazād may سكتت عن الكلام or سكتت على الكلام.
#META# Editorial declaration: Relative pronoun is usually the masculine singular alladhī.
#META# Editorial declaration: Absence of resumptive pronoun in relative clauses (e.g., اللذي ذكرناه  الذي ذكرن).
#META# Editorial declaration: Indiscriminate shape of final alif or yāʾ (e.g., بقا for بقي).
#META# Editorial declaration: Repeated use of unusual orthography that probably reflects oral pronunciation: اليل for الليل (but cf. §5.18); تعلى for تعالى.
#META# Editorial declaration: For جوارٍ or الجواري we have جوار/الجوار (but see §2.26: جواريها).
#META# Editorial declaration: Certain words or phrases consistently misspelled (e.g., يصطلى  يصطا).
#META# Editorial declaration: Idhā is frequently used for idh.
#META# Editorial declaration: To express a period of time: مدة من . . . rather than مدة in construct.
#META# Editorial declaration: Lack of coordination between temporal and main clauses (e.g., أنّه لما فرغ سندباد من ضرب مثله فقام المعلّم الثاني.).
#META# Editorial declaration: Use of the “pseudo-IVth form” (e.g., ارمى for رمى).
#META# Editorial declaration: In addition, there are several features which are linked to North African dialects:
#META# Editorial declaration: First-person verb forms are sometimes written نفعل (sing.) and [نفعلو[ا (pl.).
#META# Editorial declaration: Confusion of sīn and zāy (e.g., دهليز  دهليس).
#META# Editorial declaration: Use of dhal for dāl (أدب  اذب).
#META# Editorial declaration: Certain masculine nouns treated as feminine (e.g., khātam, “ring”).
#META# Editorial declaration: Ṭarshūnah, the editor of the previous Arabic edition, “corrected” these features to conform to classical usage. I have not done so. It was tempting to change certain features to conform to standard literary usage but ultimately it would have been an arbitrary decision as to which features to change and which to let stand.
#META# Editorial declaration: That said, a number of modifications were necessary, whether for the publication format or the legitimate expectations of the potential reader. I have broken the text into paragraphs, indicated direct speech, and added question marks where appropriate. I have also “corrected” the text in certain instances. First, as mentioned above, I have used words or phrases from another manuscript. This is done only to clarify something in A that is missing or unclear, or to enhance the narrative without disrupting it. If no source for the change is given, the reader may assume that it comes from the textual tradition of the first group of manuscripts, and within that, almost always from B2.
#META# Editorial declaration: Second, there are some cases of what one may safely say are errors rather than conventions, such as in kāmilalan for kāmilan in §1.1 or dawḥāt min dawḥāt al-wād at §5.22. This distinction, admittedly, is not always clear, and thus it is necessary to record these instances as well. (Also, the relative care taken by the scribes in copying these tales probably tells us something about the production and consumption of these copies, although admittedly we are a long way from understanding these processes.)
#META# Editorial declaration: Third, some emendations are necessary to avoid confusion. For example, to write wālid (“father”) with a short vowel, as walad, falls within acceptable Middle Arabic usage. There is, however, potential for confusion given that the latter word means “son.” Thus in §11.13, it seems reasonable to change the word; but as it is not just a matter of a typographical error, it should be recorded in the notes. Another instance is kadhā in §1.17. At first glance, this might be the common “so” or “thus”; it is in fact a rendering of kāda (“to be about to”) where the vowel lengths have shifted and dāl has become dhāl. Since these are not errors but rather indications as to how the text was read, they should not be neglected and are recorded in the critical apparatus.
#META# Editorial declaration: Finally, though, there are a number of instances where retaining the Middle Arabic features seemed gratuitous and unduly distracting, and I felt I should take the expectations of the modern reader into account. These cases are mainly grammatical: definite terms in the construct state, confusion of possessive pronouns’ gender and number, and so on. It is, for instance, strange to read bayna ʿayni-hi, “between his eye” instead of bayna ʿaynay-hi “between his two eyes.” Or qāla al-rāwī al-ḥadīth (for “the storyteller said”) instead of qāla rāwī al-ḥadīth. It would be hard to imagine a more elementary grammatical error than this last, and yet each time the phrase occurs, five times in all, it is written “incorrectly.” Obviously this is more than a one-off scribal error. In another manuscript, say a scholarly work by a single author, an incorrect iḍāfah construction is easily construed as a simple mistake. But that cannot be the case here, and it is important that the original wording be recorded. In any case, I have tried to minimize these concessions to convention, precisely to demonstrate that there are other conventions at work.
#META# Editorial declaration: These characteristics are typical of this type of literature, and I would point out that they are directly linked to language and scribal practice. In terms of content, we can accept inconsistencies and inaccuracies; we know that names will not always be written or spelled in the same manner, that geography or spatial orientation may be confused, that caliphs may be referred to as kings, and so on. Similarly, a word may be written in conventional form in one place and more phonetically in others, grammatical rules observed in one instance and flouted the next. Sometimes the storyteller uses colorful vocabulary and rhymed prose, sometimes his lexicon and his syntax are quite plain. If the narrator at times seems to be paying little attention to his story, omitting important details, or changing topic abruptly, the manuscript gives the impression that the scribe’s mind too was wandering at points during his work. Both the form and the content reflect, as Lyons claimed of Alf laylah, a text intended primarily for the ear rather than the eye. By keeping the Arabic text as close to the original as possible, we allow the eye to see what the ear might have been hearing.
#META# Editorial declaration: Ṭarshūnah also took the liberty of adjusting the poems to fit classical metres. I have freed myself from this obligation, as inconsistent metre is common for verse in this type of literature. Some readers will find this unfortunate, but it is consistent with the stated procedure of allowing the text to stand as it is. I should add that in many cases the verses could not be deciphered, and I was obliged, like Ṭarshūnah before me, to mix and match from the (plentiful) variant verses found in the other manuscripts. It is interesting to note that the variations in the poetry are much more numerous than in the narrative sections, and that frequently a manuscript will omit verses altogether. The manuscripts give the impression that the narratives were of primary importance, and the poetic insertions could be included, omitted, or modified in a liberal fashion.
#META# Editorial declaration: Reading this Arabic text may be at first disconcerting. The quantity and variety of divergences from the classical norms are distracting enough, but what can be particularly maddening is the inconsistency. The reader will note that the Middle Arabic forms listed above exist side-by-side with the classical, “correct” versions. On occasion one even finds the classical norm and Middle Arabic variant in the same sentence. However, even this inconsistency is well attested.

### | 1 حكاية مائة ليلة وليلة

# [1.1]
# قال الشيخ فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# سمع بكتابي هذا ملك من الملوك اسمه دارم.
# قال فهراس: فبعث الى ان ناتيه فاتيته فلما دخلت قصره بقيت في ضيافته شهرا
~~كاملا فلما كمل الشهر امر باحضاري فحضرت بين يديه وقال لي: اريد ان اسئلك.
# فقلت له: اسئل عما شئت.
# فقال: اخبرني عن مائة ليلة وليلة واحضر لي كتابا تجمع فيه الحديث من اوله
~~الى ءاخره.
# قلت له: نعم.
[1.2]
# بلغني ايها الملك والله اعلم بغيبه واحكم انه كان في ارض الهند ملكا
~~عادلا في رعيته وكان له في كل عام مهرجان عظيم يجتمع فيه هو واصحابه وارباب
~~دولته ويامرهم ان يلبسوا ثياب الحسان وياتيهم بالطعام والشراب فاذا اكلوا
~~وشربوا يدخل الملك الى قصره ويغيب عنهم ساعة ثم يخرج اليهم في احسن زينة
~~فيجلس على سرير ملكه فيامر بمراية عظيمة من الهند وضعت على عجلة من حديد
~~فينظر فيها وجهه ثم يقول لاصحابه وارباب دولته: هل تعلمون احدا في الدنيا
~~احسن مني صورة؟
# فيقولون: لا ايها الملك.
# قال: فيتباشر لذلك.
[1.3]
# فلما كان في بعض السنين فعل كما يفعل في كل عام فقام اليه شيخ كبير من
~~كبراء اهل دولته فقال له: ايها الملك اياك والاعجاب بنفسك فاني دخلت
~~الامصار وجلت البلاد رايت بارض بابل بمدينة خرسان شابا من ابناء التجار
~~اجمل منك وله جمال بارع وحسن رايع.
# فقال له الملك: كيف السبب في حصوله بين يدي؟ فاذا كان كما ذكرت فلامدنك
~~بالمال وان كان غير ذالك فوالله لانتقمن منك اشد الانتقام.
# فقال له الشيخ: لا يصل اليك الا بالمال والهدايا.
# فقال له الملك: لك ذلك.
[1.4]
# قال: فاخذ الشيخ كلما يصلح له في الامتعة والهدايا وصنع سفينة عظيمة وركب
~~الشيخ ومن معه فيها واقلعوا وسافروا بريح طيب مدة من شهرين كاملين حتى
~~قربوا من مدينة خرسان ودخلوا المرصى فنزل الشيخ من السفينة وهبط ما معه من
~~الدخاير والاموال واوصى بالمركب احدا من اصحابه واشترى دوابا وحمل عليهم
~~جميع ما اتى به من بلاد الهند وسار نحو مدينة خراسان فلما دخلها قصد الى
~~احسن فنادقها فاكترى فيها مصرية مليحة حسنة ووضع جميع متاعه ودخايره فيها
~~واراح نفسه.
[1.5]
# فلما كان بعد ثلاثة ايام خرج وسار نحو حانوت الخرساني بسوق العطارين فلما
~~وصل اليه سلم عليه وجلس بازايه والفتى ابنه جلس على مضربة من الديباج وعلى
~~راسه عمامة بيضا كما قال الشاعر:
# بعمامة من خده او خده منها اشرق %~%
# فكانه وكانها بدر يغيب بالشفق %~%
# فاذا دنى واذا رنا واذا تبسم او نطق %~%
# شغل الجوارح والجوانح والحذق %~%
# قال: فلما دخل الشيخ الهندي في حانوت الخرساني والد الفتى عرض عليه من
~~بعض ما اتى به من الذخاير.
[1.6]
# قال: فتعجب العطار من ذلك لانه ما عهده قط في بلاده.
# قال الشيخ الهندي: تعلم يا ابا محمد اني ما قصدت من ارض الهند الا اليك
~~لما سمعت من فضلك وودك وحسن عشرتك؟
# فقال له الخرصاني: بارك الله فيك واعاننا على اداء حقك انا اتصرف لك في
~~جميع احوالك واجتهد في بيع ما اجلبته في غاية الاجتهاد ان شاء الله.
# وفال له الهندي: جزاك الله عنا خيرا.
# ثم ان العطار دعا عبدا من عبيده وكلمه بكلام لم يفهمه الشيخ ثم عطف
~~الخرصاني على الهندي وقال له: يا سيد بفضلك عسى ان تتفضل وتسير الى منزلي
~~وتاكل من طعامي ويكون بيني وبينك دمام وعهد كريم مؤبد.
# فاجابه الهندي الى ذالك وسار معه والفتا معهما.
[1.7]
# فلما وصل الى باب الدار قرع الفتا الباب واذا بجارية خلف الباب كانها غصن
~~بان او قضيب خزران فلما راتهم قبلت الارض بين ايديهم فقال لها مولاها:
~~اصنعي لنا الطريق.
# فغابت عنهم ساعة ثم رجعت واذنت لهم الدخول.
# فدخلوا فراوا دارا حسنة البناء واسعة الفنا فقصدوا الى مجلس قد فضى فيه
~~الهوى ختامه ونشر اعلامه قد فرش بالديباج المدثر وحصر السادات ولبود
~~الطلقان ونمارق الخسروان وعلى يمين المجلس سرير وعلى يسره سرير كذلك قد قام
~~على قوايم الذهب فجلس كل واحد على مرتبة.
[1.8]
# وعطف العطار على ولده واومى اليه بكسر اجفانه لا بعبارة لسانه فاحضر من
~~حينه الجوار وقدمت الجفون بانواع لذيذ الطعام واكلوا بعد الاعدام مثل طعام
~~الخبز وغيره واللحم من البهايم والطيور من غذاء اهل خراسان من الاطعمة فبقى
~~الشيخ عند الخرساني في بر وكرامة مدة من ثلاثة ايام ثم نزله بازاء داره
~~وجعل له فيها ما يصلح به من الفراش والاواني واتخذه صاحبا وقسم الا ياكل
~~ولا يشرب الا معه في كل يوم حتى صاروا كروحين في جسد واحد ثم ان الشيخ
~~الهندي عطف على الخرصاني وقال له: اني اريد ان اعرض عليك جميع ما ءاتيت به
~~من بلاد الهند وغيرها.
[1.9]
# فلما وقف الخرصاني على جميع ذلك ورءا ما لم يرا قط قال له الهندي: يا ابا
~~محمد الم ترسل ولدك معنا الى بلاد الهند حتى اعرفه بالملوك والراسا والتجار
~~ويكون عندهم معروفا مكروما محفوظا ويتعلم التجارة؟ فانه من اهلها وما اراه
~~الا كيسا لبيبا وحادقا.
[1.10]
# قال له الخرصاني: انه قريب العهد بالعرس ولا يمكنه السفر الا بعد تمام
~~العام وايضا فلا احد مثلك في الصحبة اذا كنت تقيم عندنا الى ان يوفي حوله
~~نبعثه معك اكراما لك.
# قال: فبقا الشيخ حتى تم الفتا عاما ثم اقبل الخرصاني على ابنه وقال له:
~~يا زهر البساتين خذ على نفسك وتاهب للسفر مع الشيخ الى بلد الهند لتنظر
~~وترى المداين وتعرف الملوك والتجار.
# فقال له: يابت السمع والطاعة لله ثم لك.
[1.11]
# قال: فنظر ابوه فيما يصلح لابنه من السفر وخرج على باب المدينة ونزل بقرب
~~المنازل منها ثم ان الفتا لما تودع من ابنة عمه نسي في داره بعض حوايجه
~~فقال للشيخ: يا سيدي نسيت في داري حاجة فتربص حتى اعوذ اليك.
[1.12]
# ثم انه اتى الى منزله فوجد باب داره مفتوحا فدخل الدار وصاح بابنت عمه
~~فلم تجبه فاتى الى سريره ورفع الستر ونظر فاذا بابنت عمه نايمة والى جانبها
~~اسود نايم معها.
[1.13]
# فلما راها على تلك الحالة حيل بينه وبين عقله فرد يده على قايم سيفه
~~ودبحهما وجعل راس الجارية على صدر الاسود وراس الاسود على صدر الجارية
~~وانصرف الى الموضع الذي ترك فيه الشيخ فلما وصل ونظر فيه الشيخ فوجده قد
~~تغير لونه وشكله ثم ان الشيخ سال الفتا عن امره فكتم الفتا عليه امره ولم
~~يطلع احدا على حاله وسار حتى وصل الى السفينة.
[1.14]
# فمشوا في البحر اياما والفتا ما يزداد كل يوم الا تغيرا حتى وصلوا الى
~~مدينة الملك قاعدة مداين الهند وفيها تحط السفن الواصلة من جميع البلاد
~~فلما وصلوا الى المرسى عمدت الزوارق وخرجوا الناس في احسن زينة وخرج الملك
~~على فيل عظيم وعن يمينه عشرة علامات من انواع الحرير وفي اطراف الاسنة
~~احجار من الياقوت لها لمعان يكاد يخطف الابصار.
[1.15]
# فهبط الشيخ الهندي مع الفتى زهر البساتين في زورق حتى وصلا الى البر فاتى
~~الشيخ الى الملك وسلم عليه فلما نظر الملك الى الفتا قال للشيخ بلسان
~~الهندي: يا مدبر الرياسة.
# وكان الشيخ يدعى بهذا الاسم وقال له: اين ما ذكرت لي من جمال هذا الفتى؟
# فقال له: موعدك يا مولاي اصابه في الطريق مرض شديد وهو الذي غير لونه
~~وصفاته.
[1.16]
# فامر الملك بانزاله في دار الكرامة وان يجري عليه النفقة الى ان يجد
~~الراحة ويزيل عنه تعب السفر وكانت هذه الدار بازاء قصر الملك وكان الشيخ
~~مدبر الرياسة يفتقد الفتا في كل يوم بالمعاجن والادوية والاشربة وكلما يعلم
~~انه يصلح به والفتى ما يزداد كل يوم الا تغيرا وسقما.
[1.17]
# فبينما الفتى ذات اليوم متفكرا فيما اتفق عليه من ابنة عمه وكيف وجدها مع
~~الاسود اذ اذهبت عقله وكاد ان يموت غما مما اصابه من الفكرة فقام على قدميه
~~واقبل يدور بالدار من مكان الى مكان فرءا بابا صغيرا فدفعه فانفتح فنظر الى
~~ادراج مصنعة من الرخام المجزع فصعد عليهم الى اعلى الدار فوجد الى اعلاها
~~قبة لها اربعة ابواب يستنشق منهم الارياح الاربعة ابوابها من الصندل الاحمر
~~والعاج والابنوس مسمرة بمسامير الذهب والفضة ففتح تلك الابواب واقبل يجلو
~~بصره اذا اشرف على قصر الملك فرءا في وسطه بستانا فيه ثمار باسقة واطيار
~~ناطقة وامياه تخرج من افواه التماثيل على سهاريج مصنوعة من الرخام المجزع
~~وفي وسط البستان شجرة عالية ملتفة الاغصان متدلية الاقطار فكانها فسطاط
~~مضروب او خباء منصوب.
[1.18]
# قال: فبينما هو اقبل يجول ببصره ويستنشق نسيم تلك الازهار ويتسلا بتغريد
~~الاطيار اذا سمع في جيهة البستان حسا فالتفت نحوه فاذا بباب قد انفتح في
~~جيهة تلك البستان فخرج مقدار اربعين جارية عليهن الحلي والحلل كانهن
~~الاقمار وبينهم جارية كانها شمس ضاحية فجسدها من النور او تكون من صفاء
~~البلور للورد منها الخدود والغزلان منها الجبهة والحدق عليها حلة نسجها
~~ذهبا وعلى راسها تاج مكلل بانواع الجواهر منجم باحجار الياقوت وعلى جبينها
~~اكليل وقد تزينت باحسن الزينة والجوار بايديهن الطنابر والعيدان والمعازف
~~والمزامر والشيران واقبلن على الرقص في الشعور والاشارة بالاكمام حتى
~~توسعوا في وسط البستان.
[1.19]
# فعندما وصلن منه ارفع المراتب انبع الهوى من كل جانب فلا تسمع الا اصوات
~~المغاني على اصطفاق المثالث والمثاني ولا ترى الا ركض الارض بالاقدام
~~واشارة الجو في الاكمام.
# فلم يزلوا على ذلك ساعة من النهار.
# قال راوي الحديث: ثم ان الجارية صاحت بالجوار صيحة فلم يبق منهن حولها
~~واحدة الا فرت واختفت واذا بالجارية قد قامت ومشت في البستان حتى وصلت الى
~~الشجرة العالية العظمى الذي تقدم وصفها فدخلت تحتها وضربت برجلها الارض
~~واذا بالدفة قد ارتفعت على فم دهليس وخرج منه اسود مثل النخلة السحوقة ام
~~الفرع اللحوق وقد تهدلت شفتاه وتبرقت عيناه.
[1.20]
# قال لها: يا ابنة الزانية تركتني ها هنا اقاصي حياض الموت واشتغلت بطعامك
~~وشرابك.
# فقالت له: يا سيدي وحق راسك علي ما كنت الا مشغولة باشغال الملك وما كان
~~غرضي الا نقتله ونهلكه لكي انفرد بك فما قدرت على ذالك ولا وجدت اليه من
~~سبيل وانا عازمة على قتله واعمل الحيلة في هلاكه.
# قال: فتبسم الاسود عند ذلك وقهقه في ضحكه وقال لها: لله درك ما خفيت علي محبتك.
# ثم ضرب بيده على الجارية واضطجعها على الارض وقعد منها مقعد الرجال من
~~المراة.
[1.21]
# فلما رءا الفتى الخرصاني ذالك قال في نفسه: اواه احزن انا على ابنت عمي
~~وهذه امراة الملك لها الجوار وصنوف الحلي والحلل والمال والاكل الهني
~~والشرب الروي وخانت الملك على ما له عليها من النعم كيف انا ولا اصل الى
~~عشر معاشره في الرفعة والهيبة والمال؟ ثم انشد يقول:
# ان النسا وان وصفن بعفة %~% من لا يقاس من الامور ويفهم
# لحم يطوف به كلاب جوع %~% ان لم تصنه فانه يتقسم
# اليوم عندك سرها وحديثها %~% وغدا لغيرك فمها والمعصم
# كالبيت تعمره ويصبح خاليا %~% ويسكن فيه بعدك من لا يعلم
# قال: فلما فرغ الفتا من انشاد شعره قال: والله لا امسكت في قلبي مما كنت
~~امسكه ابدا.
# وغلق الباب ونزل الدار واقبل على الطعام والشراب فلم تاتي عليه عشرة ايام
~~الا والفتا قد عاد اليه حسنه وجماله.
[1.22]
# فسر الشيخ بذلك سرورا عظيما ثم قبله بين عينيه وانصرف راجعا الى الملك
~~واعلمه بالخبرفامر بالمهرجان على عادته وبرح في جميع بلاده ان ياتوا اليه
~~جميع الناس في احسن زينتهم وارفع لباسهم لحضور المهرجان ووعدهم ليوم معلوم.
[1.23]
# فلما جاء الوقت المعلوم اجتمعت الناس اليه حاضرة وبادية وتزينوا باحسن
~~الزينة وتزين الملك بالزينة التي كان يتزين بها وامر لاصحابه بالثياب
~~الحسان وتزينوا وجلسوا على الكراسي وامر لفتيانه فتزينوا بثياب الديباج
~~وتمنطقوا بمناطق الارجوان المرصعة بالذر والمرجان وامسكوا بايديهم المذانب
~~والمراويح ثم ان الفتى الخرصاني امر عليه الملك بكسوة حسنة وتزين باحسن
~~زينة خرسان ودخل على الملك.
[1.24]
# قال: فلم يبق في المجلس احد الا قام اليه لينظر الى جماله وكماله ثم ان
~~الملك ضرب بيده على يد الخرصاني واجلسه على سريره وامر له بتاج فالقاه على
~~راسه واكليل على جبينه وامر الملك بالمراءة الهندية فسيقت اليه على عجلة
~~حتى مثلت بين يديه ثم ان الملك نظر وجهه في المراية ونظر في وجه الفتى
~~الخرصاني وصورته في المراءة ثم دعى باهل مجلسه فقال لهم: اصدقوا ولا تقولوا
~~الا الحق من اجمل انا والا هذا الفتى؟
[1.25]
# فقالوا له: ايها الملك والله ما راينا اجمل منه في زماننا هذا.
# فقال لهم الملك: صدقتم وبالحق نطقتم.
# ثم امر برد المراءة الى موضعها وامر باطعام الطعام للناس بادية وحاضرة
~~فلما فرغوا من الاكل امرهم بالانصراف وبقى الفتى مع الملك.
[1.26]
# فقام الملك على قدميه وضرب يده على قايم سيفه وسله من غمده واوماه على
~~الفتى ليقسمه نصفين فقال له الفتى: ولم هذا ايها الملك وما اذنبت لك ذنبا؟
# فقال له: لا بد من قتلك ان لم تخبرني ما الذي غير صورتك ولونك حين وصولك
~~الى بلدي.
[1.27]
# فقال: ايها الملك كان من قصتي كذا وكذا وقص عليه قصته مع ابنت عمه وكيف
~~وجدها مع الاسود وكيف قتلهما وان ذلك غير صورتي وافسد مزاجي لما دخل قلبي
~~من الغم والفكرة.
[1.28]
# ثم اخبر الملك مما رءا في بستانه وخروج الاسود من الدهليس وما اتفق مع
~~الجارية وتدبيرها في هلاكه فلما رايت ايها الملك ما رايت عزيت نفسي وتركت
~~الفكرة وطرحت الهم من قلبي ورجعت الى النظر في امري من الاكل والشرب حتى
~~اتت الي صحتي وعاد الي حسني وجمالي.
[1.29]
# قال: فلما سمع قوله عطف عليه وقال له: من لي بصحة ما ذكرت من امر الجارية
~~والاسود؟
# فقال له: تسير معي الى الدار الذي انزلتني فيها فنصعد انا وانت الى القبة
~~حتى ترا ذالك بعينك.
# فقام الملك وقال: هذا يوم راحة وفرجة.
# ثم اخذ بيد الفتا وقال له: سر امامي.
[1.30]
# فمشا معه الى الدار وصعدا الى القبة وفتح له باب الطاقة الذي يشرف منها
~~على البستان واقبل معه في الحديث والاخبار الحسان.
# قال: فبينما هما كذلك اذا سمعوا جلبة عظيمة فتامل الملك نحوها واذا
~~بالجوار قد خرجن والجارية معهن على حسب العادة حتى وصلو الى البستان واقبلن
~~على الملاهي والرقص في الشعور.
[1.31]
# فادركت الملك الغيرة وقال للفتى: اين ما ذكرت لي؟ وانما اردت الكشف عن
~~حريمي وتعلم ان الملوك لا يصبرون على ثلاثة اشياء: القدح في الملوك والتعرض
~~للحريم وافشاء السر.
# فقال له الفتى: لا تعجل ايها الملك واصبر قليلا ترى عجبا.
[1.32]
# قال: فبينما هما كذلك واذا بالجارية قد صاحت على الجواري فهربن واختفين
~~واقبلت الجارية الى الشجرة المذكورة فضربت برجلها الارض وارتفعت الدفة عن
~~فم الدهليس وخرج منها الاسود فضرب بيده على يد الجارية وعاتبها على مغيبها
~~عتابا شديدا فاعتذرت له مثل عذرها الاول فقضى حاجته منها والملك ينظر اليه.
[1.33]
# فقال له الفتى: كيف رايت ايها الملك؟
# فقال له الملك: لا ملام عليك.
[1.34]
# ثم ان الملك نزل ودخل الى قصره فاخذ الجارية والجوار التي كنا معها فضرب
~~رقابهن واحضر الاسود فقتله واخذ راسه وراس الجارية وجعلهما في طاسة ووجههما
~~للفتى الخرصاني.
# فلما دخل عليه ونظر الى الراسين فقال له: ايها الملك ما هذا؟
# قال: هما راس الاسود والجارية.
# ثم ان الملك حرم على نفسه زواج النساء.
[1.35]
# واقام مع الفتى الى ان اشتاق الفتى الرجوع الى اهله فاعلم الملك بذلك
~~فهيا له مركبا وساق له مما في بلاد الهند من الدخاير النفيسة والسلع وودعه
~~وانصرف الفتى الى ابيه.
[1.36]
# قال: وبقى الملك زمانا طويلا لم يتزوج ثم بعد ذالك تزوج ابنة حسنة وبات
~~معها الى الصبح وقتلها وصار كل ليلة يدخل بابنة ويقتلها صباحا حتى اتى على
~~جميع بلده ولم يبق الا جاريتين للوزير فخطب الملك احدهما وكان اسمها
~~دينارزاد فلم يسمعه الا ان قال له: قد اعطيتك.
[1.37]
# ودخل الوزير على اهله وهو مهموم.
# قال له ابنته الثانية وكان اسمها شهرزاد: ما لي اراك مهموما؟
# قال: كيف لا احزن والملك خاطبني في اختك يبيت معها ليلة ويقتلها ويكمل بك
~~انت في غد؟
# فقالت له: لا تحزن وامضي له وقل له ان البنات استانسوا ببعضهم بعضا ولاكن
~~اخطبهم الاثنين مني وادخل الليلة بدينارزاد وغدا بشهرزاد وتكون عند اختها
~~ببيت اخرى تستانس بها.
[1.38]
# قال الملك: نعم انا اقبلتهما.
# قال الوزير: وانا اعطيتهما لك.
# فدخل الملك بدينارزاد فلما قرب الاجل الذي يقتل فيه الملك ازواجه قالت
~~دينارزاد: يا ختي يا شهرزاد تعالي حدثي الملك باحاديثك الحسان.
# قالت: نعم.
# فبدات تحدثه من حديث محمد بن عبدالله القيرواني.
# فلما سمع كلامها اعجبه واطلع عليه النهار فقالت شهرزاد: والله ان خليت
~~اختي الى الليلة المقبلة لاحدثنك بحديث اغرب من هاذا.
# قال لها: نعم.
# ثم انه طبع بطابعه وخرج الى مجلس حكمه لتدبير مملكته.
[1.39]
# قال: ثم اتى الليل فنام الملك والجارية الى الوقت المعلوم حتى انتبه الملك.
# فلما احست به نادت: يا ختي يا شهرزاد تعالي حدثي مولانا باحاديثك الجياد.
# فبدات تحدثه من اين وقفت في الليلة الاولى الى ان اصبح الله بخير الصباح
~~صنع بها مثل اليوم الاول فبقت تحدثه كل ليلة بحديث الى ان وفت ماية ليلة
~~وليلة طلعت دينارزاد حاملا من الملك فاعطاها الامان وبطلت شهرزاد الاجتماع به.
### | 2 حديث الفتا التاجر

### || 2.1
[2.1]
# قالت ذكروا والله اعلم بغيبه واحكم انه كان رجل من بني التجار ذو مال جزيل وحال عظيم وكان له ولد املح خلق الله تعلى صورة فعلمه ابوه جميع الاذب والاخبار وما يمكنه ان يعلمه اولاد التجار.
# فلما ان حضرت وفات التاجر والد الفتى دعا بابنه وقال له: يا ابني اني ميت لا محالة ولاكن اوصيك بوصية فاقبلها مني ولا تخالفني فتندم.
# فقال له الفتى: وما هي يا ابي؟
# قال له: يا بني لا تتجر بدين لا لك ولا عليك.
# قال: نعم يا ابت.
[2.2]
# ثم قام بعد ذلك ابوه اياما يسيرة وتوفي رحمه الله فاخذ ابنه ماله كله حتى اجتمع له الفين من الدنانير فقال الفتا في نفسه: اني ارجع في موضع ابي فالزم فيه البيع والشرا والاخذ والعطا ولا ابيع بدين كما اوصاني ابي ولا اشتري بدين.
# فطلع في حنوت ابيه فصار يبيع ويشتري كما امره ابوه مدة من عام كامل فلما تم العام اشتهر الفتى عند جميع التجار انه لا يبيع بدين ولا يشتري بدين.
[2.3]
# قال: فبينما هو ذات يوم جالس في حانوته واذا بالدلالين قد اتوا اليه وقالوا له: ايها الفتى انت عندك الفين دينار فان عزمت ان تطلع الى حانوتك سلاع ومتاع باثنى عشر الف دينار مكناك من ذلك.
# قال لهم الفتى: بما يمكن ذلك؟
# فقالوا له: نبيعوا لك سلعة بعشرين الاف دينار فبع واعط لارباب السلع وتاخذ مثلها فايدة وتعطينا الاجرة لا زايد.
# ولم يزالوا يلحون عليه حتى انعم لهم بذلك ونسي وصية ابيه اليه فاتوه الدلالون بالسلع والامتعة من كل جانب فاخذها ودفع لكل واحد من الدلالين اجرته فما اذن العصر الا وقد دفع الالفي دينار وامتلات عليه الخزاين بالامتعة والسلع.
[2.4]
# فبقي الفتى بقية يومه الى اليل لم يبع شيئا ولم يشتري شيئا وسار الى منزله فلما اصبح الله بخير الصباح اتى الفتا الى الحانوت وقام فيها يومه الى اليل لم يبع شيئا ولم يشتري شيئا فشق ذلك عليه واهتم لذلك هما عظيما.
# ثم سار الى منزله وهو مهموم حزين متفكر في وصية ابيه وقد ندم ندما شديدا على ما عمل وقال في نفسه: كيف تكون الحيلة اذا اتى الي بعض اصحاب الامتعة يطلبون متاعهم؟ ما يكون قولي اليهم؟ نبيع متاع هذا واعطيه لهذا واخسر اموال الناس ومالي بينهم.
[2.5]
# قال: فبينما هو كذلك جالس عند باب داره واذا بشيخ كبير من اصحاب ابيه قد خلط عليه فسلم عليه فرد الفتى عليه السلام فقال له الشيخ: ما الذي اصابك ودهاك واعتراك؟
# فقال له الفتى: يا سيدي اني قد عصيت ابي ولم اقبل وصيته ولا عملت بها فخسرت الفي دينار في يوم واحد.
[2.6]
# فقال له الشيخ: ادخل الى دارك وتمارض فيها ولا يدخل ولا يخرج عليك احد ومن سال عنك قل له مريض.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت على الكلام فقام الملك متعجبا من حديثها وغلق عليها الباب وخاتمه بطابعه وانصرف الى مجلس حكمه.
### || 2.2 الليلة الثانية

# [2.7]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# فلما كانت الليلة القابلة اتى الملك على عادته وفك الطابع ونام مع
~~الجارية الى الوقت المعلوم نادت دينار زاد: يا اختي شهرزاد حدثي سيدنا
~~الملك باحاديثك الحسان.
# قالت: نعم.
[2.8]
# وذلك انه تمارض الفتى وبات الشيخ تلك الليلة فلما اصبح الله بخير الصباح
~~مشا الشيخ الى السوق وجلس في اول حانوت من حوانيت التجار وكانوا يعرفونه
~~بالصلاح والسداد وكان يكثر الجلوس عند الفتى التاجر فسئلوه التجار على
~~الفتا فقال لهم انه مريض فما زال يمشي من حانوت الى حانوت فاذا ساله احد
~~على الفتى يقل له مريض الى ان دار بالسوق كله من اوله الى ءاخره حتى اعلم
~~من في السوق انه مريض.
[2.9]
# فلما كان في اليوم الثالث ظم الشيخ الى نفسه عشرة من المشايخ واخذ مناديا
~~واتوا الى السوق وقال لهم: ايها الناس رحمكم الله من به منكم خيرا وسهل
~~عليه فليحضر جنازة الشاب التاجر الزكي جنازة محمد بن عبد الله القيرواني
~~توفي البارحة رحمه الله.
# قال: فضجوا الناس ثم تاسفوا عليه فاتى الى الحانوت واخذ شقة وقطع منها
~~كفنا واعطى بعض دراهم لرجل ليشتري حنوطا وما يحتاج اليه من جهاز الميت.
[2.10]
# فلما راوا التجار اصحاب الامتعة ذالك اتوا الى الشيخ وقالوا له: ايها
~~الشيخ ان الفتا قد اشترى منا متاعا كثيرا ولم يدفع لنا شيئا من ثمنه.
# فقال لهم الشيخ: اني لا اعرف شيئا مما تقولون لانه كان يتجر بماله ولا
~~يشتري بدين ولا يبيع بدين.
# فقالوا له: انما اموالنا عنده.
# قال: فعند ذلك نادى الشيخ: يا اهل السوق هل تعلمون ان هذا الفتى مند طلع
~~عندكم الى هذا الحانوت كان يتجر بدين ام لا؟
# فقالوا له كلهم: ما راينه قط يتجر بدين ولا يبيع بدين.
# فبقوا حايرين لا يدرون ما يصنعون.
[2.11]
# وكان فيهم تاجرا قد جرب الامور ومارس الدهور فقرب من الشيخ وسره في اذنه
~~وقال له: يا سيد ايذهب مالي كله؟ فدلني على ما اصنع.
# فقال له الشيخ: اشتري مالك بما لك اعطني دينارا اجرة ودينار زايد وخذ مالك.
# فقال له: نعم.
# فاعطاه التاجر دينارين واخذ ماله كله وانصرف التاجر فاتوه جميع التجار
~~الى الشيخ وقالوا له: ما لك تدفع لهذا متاعه؟
# قال لهم: نعم ان الفتا ما مات حتى اوصاني.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت على الكلام.
### || 2.3 الليلة الثالثة

# [2.12]
# قالت وذلك يا مولاي فاتبع الشيخ تاجر ءاخر وساله عن القصة فاعلمه بالخبر
~~فما زال كذلك كل واحد من التجار اصحاب الامتعة يعطي دينارين وياخذ متاعه
~~حتى ظم الشيخ للفتا متاعه وزيادة الف دينار وجعل ذلك كله في حانوت الفتا
~~وغلق الخزاين والحانوت وانصرف الى دار الفتى مع جملة الناس وهو يبكي
~~واصحابه يبكون واشياخ الموضع معهم والكفن والحنوط بايد احدهم.
# فلما قربوا من الدار سمعوا ضجة كبيرة وولاول قد قامت في الدار حتى استجاب
~~لها تلك النواحي من شدة الفرح والصياح.
[2.13]
# وكان الشيخ قد وصاهم وقال لهم اذا انا اتيت مع الناس والمشايخ الى باب
~~الدار قوموا باجمعكم بالولاول واخرجوا الينا من بعض الطريق وقولوا لنا ان
~~مولانا قد عاش والذي قد اصابه من غم اغمي عليه واليوم زال عنه وقد افاق.
# فلما خرجوا الخدام وتلقوا الناس قال الشيخ: ما الخبر؟
# قلن له: ان مولانا قد افاق من اغمايه.
# فسر الشيخ بذلك سرورا عظيما ورد الشيخ راسه الى الاشياخ وشكرهم على فعلهم
~~الجميل بعدما كان شيع المال الى دار الفتى ثم اخذ الكفن والحنوط وتصدق بهم
~~وانصرف القوم ودخل الشيخ على الفتى وقال له: كيف رايت يا ابني محاولتي اليهم؟
# فقال له الفتى: لله درك يا عم.
[2.14]
# فقال له الشيخ: اياك ان تعود الى مثلها واحفظ وصية ابيك.
# ثم قال له: اقم في دارك ولا تظهر لاحد ثلاثين يوما ولا يدخل عليك احد.
# فقال له: نعم
# قال: فاقام ما امره به الشيخ فلما تمت له ثلاثون يوما نظر الفتى في
~~الخروج من المدينة والسفر وكان والده ايضا قد وصاه وقال له: يا ابني اذا
~~مشيت مسافرا في رفقة فلا تمش معها بل تقدم بعشرة اميال او تاخر بمثلها.
# ثم ان الفتى تودع من اهله ومن الشيخ وسار يقطع الارض بالطول والعرض.
[2.15]
# قال فبينما هو يسير يوما من الايام في الطريق وقد تقدم على الرفقة نحو
~~عشرة اميال اذا سمع صوتا يناديه باسمه: يا محمد بن عبد الله القيرواني.
# فجال وبصره نحو الصوت اذا نظر الى حجر نابت على حاشية الطريق فقرب منه
~~فاذا خلف الحجر جارية وهي عريانة لا يواريها شيء فقال لها: من انت يا جارية؟
# فقالت له: انا ابنت فلان التاجر.
# وانتسبت الى تاجر من اصحاب ابيه وكان الفتى يعرفه.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت على الكلام.
### || 2.4 الليلة الرابعة

# [2.16]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك لما قال لها ابن التاجر: ما الذي القاك في هذا
~~الموضع يا جارية؟
# قالت له: اني سافرت مع ابي فخرج علينا اللصوص وقتلوا اهل القافلة واخذوا
~~ابي اسيرا ففرت انا على وجهي الى هذا الموضع ولاكن يا سيدي قد استجرت بك.
# فالقى الفتا عليها ثوبا من ثيابه واردفها خلفه وسار بها الى موضع النزول
~~فانزلها في موضع وضرب لها فسطاط فلم تكن الا ساعة واذا بالرفقة قد لحقت
~~عليهم فامرهم بالنزول فنزلوا ثم دفع الى احد عبيده دراهيم فاشترى له كبشا
~~فذبحه وصنع منه طعاما واطعم اهل الرفقة واخذ من اللحم والخبز وجعله في طبق
~~واتى به الى الجارية فنظر اليها والى وجهها كانه فلقة قمر او سبكة فضا.
[2.17]
# فاعجبته وقال في نفسه اذا جن اليل ونامت العيون نسير اليها ونقضي منها وطري.
# فلما جن اليل ونامت العيون قام الفتا ومشى الى تلك الجارية فلم يجد لها
~~خبر فتعجب من ذالك وقال: يا ليت شعري ما هذا الامر ومن هي وهل هي من الانس
~~ام من الجن؟
# وبات تلك الليلة متفكرا في امرها فلما اصبح الله بخير الصباح رحلت الرفقة
~~وربط ناقته ومشا امام الرفقة.
# فبينما هو في بعض الطريق اذا نودي باسمه: يا محمد بن عبد الله القيرواني.
[2.18]
# فالتفت ينظر فرءا الجارية خلف الحجر على قرعة الطريق على الصورة التي
~~كانت عليها بالامس فقرب منها وسلم عليها فقالت له: يا غدار اردت بالامس ان
~~تخون العزيز الجبار فهل لا صبرت على نفسك حتى يكون حلالا ما لم يكن حرام
~~ولاكن الذنب مغفورا لك لانك شابا صغير السن لم تجرب الامور.
# ثم ان الفتا اعطاها ثوبا فالبسته واردفها خلفه وسارت معه الى الموضع
~~النزول فنزلها عند القافلة وضرب لها الفسطاط على سبيل العادة ولم يبرز منه
~~شيء في يومه كله فلما كان في جوف اليل قام اليها ليفعل بها ما اراد ان
~~يفعله في الليلة الاولى فلما وصل ودخل الفسطاط لم يجد لها خبر ولا وقع لها
~~على اثر.
[2.19]
# فصار يطلبها في الرفقة فلم يجدها فبقي الفتى متعجبا في ذلك فبات في قلق
~~فلما اصبح الله بخير الصباح ورحلت القافلة وركب الفتا دابته وسار يقطع
~~الارض بالطول والعرض امام القافلة على عادته فبينما هو يسير في فلات من
~~الارض اذا سمع الندا: يا محمد بن عبد الله القيرواني.
# فالتفت فاذا هو بالجارية عريانة فسار نحوها وسلم عليها فردت عليه السلام
~~وقالت له: يا غدار اردت البارحة ان تعصي العزيز الجبار واردت ان تفعل ما
~~اردت تفعله الليلة الاولى ولاكن الذنب مغفورا لك لانا خلقنا للرجال فتنة.
[2.20]
# ثم ان الفتا اخذ ثوبا من عليه والقاه عليها واردفها خلفه كما جرت العادة
~~ومشى حتى اشتدت عليهما حر الشمس وكادوا ان يهلكوا من الحر.
# فقالت له: يا سيدي والله قد ضرنا الحر فاعدل بنا الى شجرة هنا اعرف تحتها
~~عينا من الماء نستضل تحتها ونشربوا من عين ونريحوا بانفسنا حتى تلحقنا
~~القافلة ويبرد النهار فقال لها: نعم الراي ما رايته.
[2.21]
# ثم ان الجارية عمدت به الى ذالك الموضع لا يمكن لاهل الرفقة الوصول اليه
~~والى الجارية فلما وصل تحت الشجرة قال في نفسه: انال من هذه الجارية غرضي
~~ومرغوبي وافوز منها بمطلوبي.
# قال: فبقا الفتا متفكرا في امر الجارية واذا بالجارية قد قامت على قدميها
~~واختطفت الفتى ورفعته من الارض وضربت به الارض وشالته بالقيد كتافا وربطته
~~الى الشجرة.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.
### || 2.5 الليلة الخامسة

# [2.22]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت يا مولاي وذلك لما افاق الفتى من غشيته وجد روحه مربوط الى الشجرة
~~فقال لها: ما هذا؟
# فقالت له: هيهات ان لا يخلصك احد من يدي وان لي منذ اعوام انتظر وانك تقع
~~في يدي فلم اجدك ولا قدرت ولا وقعت في يدي الا في هذه الساعة.
# ثم ركبت الجواد واخذت الفتى خلفها وسارت به في البرية الى ان وصلت به الى
~~قصر في الصحرا ليس فيه عمارة وقد دارت به الثمار والانهار فانزلته هناك الى
~~شجرة وربطته اليها وتركته وسارت عنه وبقا الفتا هناك يومه.
[2.23]
# فلما قرب المساء اذا هو بعشرة فوارس قد خرجوا القصر يقدمهم فارس راكب على
~~فيل عظيم وءاخر راكب على اسد فلما قربوا منه قال الراكب على الاسد: من يكن
~~هذا الفارس المربوط ها هنا وعهدي بهذا الموضع انه لا يدخله احد.
# فقالوا له احد اصحابه.
# اظنه رجل غريب بعيد الديار قد خرجوا عليه اللصوص وسلبوا ما له وتركوه في
~~هذا الموضع وصنعوا به ما ترون.
# قال: فعطف عليه الفارس وقال لهم: هو من اضيافنا في هذه الليلة.
[2.24]
# فحلوا وثاقه وادخلوه معهم في القصر فنظر الفتى الى قصر تكل عنه الاوصاف
~~فقصدوا الى مجلس قد فض فيه الهوى ختامه ونشر أعلامه ثم ان البطل صاحب الاسد
~~نزل في مرتبة ونزلوا الابطال اصحابه في مراتبهم ثم دعا عند ذلك بالطعام
~~والشراب وباقوا ياكلون ويشربون باقية يومهم الى اليل فلما جن عليهم اليل
~~اتوا بالشمع فاركزت على حسك من الذهب واقبلوا على طعامهم وشرابهم الى ان
~~سكروا القوم وطارت العمايم عن رءوسهم وانسدلت شعورهم وبانت لهم ذوايب
~~كاذناب الابل.
[2.25]
# واذا بهن جوار في زي الابطال والجارية التي كانت راكبة على الاسد هي التي
~~احتالت على الفتى فقالت له عند ذلك: يا محمد بن عبد الله القيرواني والله
~~لا خرجت من هذا القصر ابدا ولك الطعام والشراب ما اشتهيت.
# فقام الفتى عشرة ايام في اكل هني وشرب روي.
# فلما كان في اليوم الحادي عشر عطفت الجارية عليه وقالت له: يا محمد بن
~~عبد الله قد اردناك لانفسنا ولا يكون ما اردت حتى نرجع من حاجة قد تعرضت لي
~~وانا اغيب عنك سبعة ايام ونرجع ويكون ما تريد واريده الا انه على شرط.
# فقال لها: وما شرطك؟
[2.26]
# قالت له: انك تتصرف في كل شيء من القصر الا تلك البيت.
# واشارت الى بيت في القصر وتودعت منه وسارت مع جواريها تجد في السير وبقا
~~الفتا ياكل ويشرب حتى تمت له خمسة ايام فلما كان في اليوم السادس استوحش
~~وحشة شديدة وانشد وجعل يقول:
# غريب تفكر في ما مضا %~% وفي القلب كحجر الغضا
# فان كان ربي قضى غربتي %~% فصبر جميل على ما قضا
# ثم قال: والله ما بعد هذا الا الموت والله حتى افتح هذا البيت حتى ارى ما
~~فيه ولا يكون الا ما اراد الله لقد والله بغظت الحياة في هذه الدنيا.
[2.27]
# ثم انه قام وفتح باب البيت ودخل فلم يجد شيئا فقال: ان هذا والله هو العجب.
# قال: فبينما هو كذالك يتعجب ويتامل اذا رءا قبران في تلك البيت فقرب
~~منهما واذا عليهما الواح من الرخام منقوش فيها بالخط الهندي كلام لا يفهمه
~~احد فبينما هو كذالك يطيل النظر اذ لاح له بين القبرين دفة من حديد وفيها
~~حلقة من الفضا البيضا فقال الفتى في نفسه: ما هذا الدفة الا على شيء يخرج
~~من القصر ولاجل ذلك منعتني من الدخول الى هذا الموضع ليلا اخرج منه.
[2.28]
# ثم مسك الحلقة واقبل يدورها واذا هي تدور والدفة ترتفع الى ان زالت عن فم
~~دهليس فنظر فاذا هو بادراج تحتها.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت على الكلام.
### || 2.6 الليلة السادسة

# [2.29]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك ان الفتى اتى الى الادراج ونزل مقدار خمسة ادراج
~~واذا بالدفة قد انطبقت عليه واظلم الموضع عليه فاراد الرجوع فلم يجد اليه
~~سبيل ثم اقبل يرفع الدفة فوجدها مطبوقة فحركها فلم تتحرك فايقن الفتا
~~بالهلاك وقال في نفسه: ها هنا اموت وفي هذا الموضع يكون فيه قبري.
[2.30]
# ثم نزل مع الادراج الى ءاخر درجة منها فاذا هي بساحة عظيمة فجعل يمشي في
~~تلك الساحة واذا بالضوء قد لاح له فاقبل نحوه اذا سمع جري الماء فقصده فاذا
~~هو بمغارة يخرج منها الما الى مرج افوح من المسك يشقه واذا من اودية ذوي
~~الخضورة المسك على حافته ينشر ام سحيق العنبر.
# قال: فتامل الفتى الى النهر وجعل يتعجب من حسنه وخضورته اذا نظر الى
~~زوارق من العود الهندي وهو في وسط النهر وقد حشيت تلك الزواريق بجوار كانهن
~~الاقمار وبايديهن الطنابر والعيدان والمعازف والشيران وهن يرقصن في الشعور
~~وعليهم مصبغات الثياب من انواع الحرير الاحمر وقبة مضروبة بازاء النهر بيضا
~~وشرايطها من الحرير الاخضر واوتادها من النحاس الاصفر.
[2.31]
# وقد رفعت اطناب تلك القبة وفي وسطها مرتبة عظيمة مفروشة بانواع الحرير
~~والديباج وعلى المرتبة العظيمة جارية اجمل من مشا على قدم من عرب ومن عجم
~~وقد دارت بها اربعين جارية عليهن الحلي والحلل وعلى راس الجارية تاج من
~~الذهب مكلل باصناف الذر والياقوت والجواهر يساوي ملك الدنيا كله فلما نظروا
~~الجوار للفتى خرج من باب المغارة وقع الصياح في الارض وهربت الجوار من تلك
~~الزواريق وخرجوا الى الناحية الاخرى الى جهة القبة.
[2.32]
# وكان بالقرب من ذلك الواد قبة عظيمة قد بنيت بالكذان المنجور والرخام
~~المنشور.
# قال: فبينما الفتى يتامل في تلك القبة اذا هو بنحو اربعين عبدا قد لبسوا
~~القفاطي وفي ايديهم الدبابيس من الحديد فاحاطوا عند ذلك بالفتى وقالوا له:
~~من الانس انت ام من الجن؟
# فقال لهم: انا من الانس
# فقالوا له: فكيف وصلت الى هذا الموضع وخرجت من تلك المغارة وهي مغارة
~~العفاريت؟
# ثم سمع فيهم الصياح والعويل وكلام لم يفهم فقال لهم: انا من الانس ولا
~~اعلم شيئا مما تقولون.
[2.33]
# فاخذوه عند ذلك وحملوه الى المدينة وادخلوه على الملك فقال لهم الملك: ما هذا؟
# قالوا له: ايها الملك هذا قد وجدناه خرج من مغارات العفاريت وسقناه اليك.
# فلما سمع الملك بذلك سر به سرورا عظيما وساله عن حاله فاخبره الفتا بقصته
~~وما جرا له مع الجارية الجنية فقال له الملك: يا فتى انت الذي رايت في
~~النوم وهممت بك ولا يكون تمام ملكي الا بك.
# فقال له الفتى: ايها الملك اصنع بي ما اراد الله تعلى.
[2.34]
# قال: فعند ذالك دعى الملك براساء قومه وارباب دولته ووزرايه وزوجه من
~~ابنته وصنع له مهرجانا عظيما لم يرا الراءون مثله واقام الفتى مع الملك
~~كذلك مدة يسيرة وتوفي الملك وتولى الفتى الملك وبعث الى اهله وقرابته وجميع
~~من كان معه من الاحباب في هذه فوصلوا اليه في احسن حال واقام الفتى في ملكه
~~في اكل هني وشرب روي حتى اتاهم اليقين والحمد لله رب العالمين.
### | 3 حديث نجم الضيا بن مدير الملك

### || 3.1
[3.1]
# ثم قالت: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان ملكا من ملوك الارض قد ملك بالطول والعرض وكان اسمه مدير الملك بن تاج العز وكان له ولدا اسمه نجم الضيا وكان جميل الوجه وكان قد تعلم ركوب الخيل وخوضان الليل والطعن بالسنان والضرب بالحسام ومبارزة الابطال والفرسان فراد ابوه ان يزوجه بجارية من بنات الملوك فجمعوا رءوساء قومه وعشيرته.
# هنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.
### || 3.2 الليلة السابعة

# [3.2]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك ان الملك لما جمع اهله وعشيرته قال لهم: اني اريد ان
~~ازوج لابني فدلوني على جارية من بنات الملوك تكون احسن خلق الله صورة
~~ازوجها لابني نجم الضيا.
# فقام اليه رجل من بين الناس شيخ كبير السن قد دخل البلاد والاقطار صاحب
~~اهل الدهر والامصار فقال: ايها الملك السعيد اعرفك بجارية ما مثلها ولا
~~اجمل منها واسمها نايرة الاشراق بنت جدار العز وابوها صاحب ارض النوار
~~وقصور الازاهر.
[3.3]
# قال: فنظر الملك في هدية عجيبة لم يرا الراءون مثلها وبعث بها الى الملك
~~ابو الجارية مع وزيرا من وزرايه ومعها جملة من رجاله وساروا به الى ان
~~وصلوا الى ارض جدار العز والد الجارية وقد كان كتب له الملك في امر ابنته

~~واصحابه في قصره في موضع حسن وبلغ في اكرامهم واقبل الهدية واقاموا في
~~الضيافة شهرا كاملا فلما تم الشهر امر الملك بعقد النكاح وصنع مهرجانا
~~عظيما ونظر في ارسال ابنته بهدية عظيمة وصرفها مع الوزير الواصل اليه.

# فلما وصل العفريت وقرب منها راته مخضبا بالدما فقالت له: نفسي لك الفدا

# فقالت له الجارية: ما يصلح بك من الادوية؟ فاعلمني بها لعلي اصلح لك شييء
~~ليلا يشتد عليك الالم فاخاف عليك من الموت.
# فقال لها العفريت: لا باس عليك ولا تخافي علي من القتل فاني لا اموت الا
~~بسكين من القصب ولم يكن هذا القصب الا في ارضي ولا يقدر احد على الدخول الى
~~ارضي هذه.
[3.29]
# فقالت له الجارية: الحمد لله يا سيدي على ما ذكرت.
# ثم بات تلك الليلة.
# فلما اصبح الله بخير الصباح خرج العفريت وقد ركب على اسد عظيم وتقلد
~~بسيفين وتعمم بجلد ثعبان وسار في البرية فقامت الجارية ثم عطفت على ابن
~~الملك وقالت له: خذ هذا السيف بيدك واخرج الى الراعي واسئله على القصب
~~الفلاني وكان هذا العفريت لا يقتله ولا يموت الا بسكين من تلك القصب والقصب
~~لا يعرفه احد الا هو والراعي فاخرج الى الراعي واساله عن القصب اين هو فاذا

[3.30]
# قال: ثم ان الفتى خرج الى الراعي وسئله على القصب فاخبره اين هي ثم قتله
~~وسار نحو الموضع القصب واخذ منها ما يحتاج اليه ورجع الى القصر فصنع من ذلك

# فلم يزالوا كذلك ينتظرونه حتى اقبل اليل ولم ياتي اليهم فقال ابن الملك
~~للجارية: ان هذا العفريت قد ابطا وما اظن ان ذلك عادته.
# قالت له الجارية: والله وحق راسك العزيز علي ما غاب عني ليلة واحدة قط
~~وما اظنه اختبس الا لامر نزل به.

[3.31]
# فلما اصبح الله بخير الصباح انتظرا العفريت فلم ياتي ذلك اليوم الى اليل

~~فكيف يدخل قصرك وانا في كل يوم من الايام ارتقب عسى ان احدا من الادميين
~~يدخل ارضك لعلي اسئله عن ارضنا كيف هي وعن بلادنا واهلينا فما رايت احدا.
[3.35]
# فقال لها العفريت: والله ان هذا الامر قد اثر في خاطري وسرني.
# فقالت له الجارية: والله ما دخل احد غير الراعي الذي يرعى غنمك لانه لا
~~يزال يطرق القصر طول الليلة يونسني ويحدثني بالحديث العجيب والاخبار الغريب

# قال: فلما سمع العفريت كلامها صمت عنها وامرها باحضار الطعام والشراب
~~فاكلوا جميعا فمن كثرة ما اصاب العفريت من التعب العظيم في سفره نام بعد اكله.
# فقامت الجارية مسرعة الى ابن الملك وفتحت عليه الباب واخرجته من البيت

[3.36]
# فاخبرته بما ذكر لها وانه اشغلته حتى نام: فسر اليه والله تعلى يعينك على

# فلما شرفنا عليها خرجوا الينا اهلها بالدبابيس والرماح وسمعت في داخل المدينة ضجة عظيمة فبينما نحن باهتين ولاكن ليس لنا ملجا الى المدينة وكان اسم مالكها حمدان وكان جبارا من الجبابرة وقيصر من القياصرة شديد القوة والتجبر عظيم النجدة والتكبر.

### | 5 حديث ضافر بن لاحق

### || 5.1
[5.1]
# ثم قالت: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان ملكا من الملوك وكان بارض الهند و كان له ولد اسمه ظافر بن لاحق وكان ابن امة لان امه كانت جارية وكان له ولد ءاخر من ابنة عمه وكانت ابنت عمه تشهي في حتف ربيبها ضافر حتى اعطى الخلافة لولدها فسمع ضافر بذلك وكلما جرا في جانبه من امر اخيه وما يراد به من الاهانة فقال: ما بعد هذا الا الموت.
[5.2]
# فعطف ظافر على اخيه وقال له: والله يا اخي لا رايتني بعد هذه الليلة ابدا.
# فقال له: ولم ذلك؟
# قال له: لامر قد اصابني وبلغ مني الجهد.
# ثم رجع ظافر الى منزله وركب جواده ولبس لامة واخذ بيده حربة وسار من المدينة في ظلام اليل ثم جعل يهيم في البرية مثل النعايم يمينا وشمالا فلم يصبح الصباح عليه الا وهو على بعد من المدينة.
[5.3]
# فما زال يقطع الارض بالطول والعرض والاكام والاجام والتلال والرمال والاودية والجبال في ارض سودا جردا كثيرة الوهج وهي مسودة التراب خفية الاجناب يحير فيها ذوي الالباب ليس فيها انس ولا انيس ولا حس ولا حسيس الا المردة من اولاد ابليس لو دخلها ذيب الا وعطش ولا اسد الا ودهش كما قال فيها الشاعر:
# ارض سراب عمرت بالسودا %~% عساكرها الجن اناخوا بها
# نباتها الصلصال من حرمل %~% واعشب القندول في غابتها
[5.4]
# قال راوي الحديث: فمشا ظافر في هذه الارض مدة من خمسة ايام فلما كان في اليوم السادس اذا اشرف على ارض بيضا كانها سبايك الفضة يفوح نسيمها ويشقها واد من اودية الحماد الخضرة واللواء اخضر نظير سريس زهي يزهر المسك من حافته ينتشر قد كثرت حمراته وظهرت بركاته فاشجاره باسقة واطياره ناطقة واغصانه متدلية وغدرانه ممتلية وفيه اطيار مثل البلبل والكروان والقمري والورشان والحمام وام الحسن تغرد على الاغصان من كل ناحية ومكان.
# فلما نظر ظافر الى ذلك الواد وحسن انحداره كانه ثعبان انسلخ من جلده ام حسام تجرد من غمده فلما قرب من الواد ترجل عن جواده وشرب من الماء وسقا جواده وبسط جحفته وترك جواده يرعى كلا من الارض.
[5.5]
# فاراد ان ينام اذا كانت منه التفاته فنظر على شاطي الواد من الناحية الاخرى قبة من الشقيقة الأبيض وامامها قناة مركوزة وجواد مربوط وصارم معلق.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.
### || 5.2 الليلة الثامنة عشر

# [5.6]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك لما رءا ضافر القبة تحيل الى ان جاز الواد ووصل الى
~~القبة ونادى بارفع صوته: السلام عليكم يا اهل هذه القبة.
[5.7]
# فلم يتم كلامه الا واطناب القبة قد ارتفعت وبرزوا من تحتها ثلاث جوار
~~نواهد ابكار كانهن الاقمار باعناق كالبلار ومباسم كالجلنار عليهن من الحلي
~~والحلل ما لا يوصف فقالوا: يا هذا الفارس اما صبت ناهي ينهاك عن دخول هذا
~~الواد؟ اما زجرك زاجر؟ فكان والله تندبك النوادب وتبكي عليك الاحبة
~~والاقارب.
# فقال ابن الملك: ومن يفعل ذلك؟
# قلن له: صاحب هذه القبة بطل من الابطال لا يصطلى له بنار ولا يسكن له بجوار
# فقال لهن: ما اسمه فيعرف وما كنيته فيوصف؟
# فقلن له: اسمه فهو موصوف وخبره معروف وهو والله الطامة الكبرى والداهية
~~العظمى هو والله مفرق الكتايب ومظهر العجايب وهو فلاق الجماجم صاحب وادي
~~الاعاجم.
[5.8]
# قال: فبينما الفتى يخاطب الجوار اذ لاح له غبار فقالوا له: يا هذا الفارس
~~هذا هو البطل الذي ذكرن لك فانج بنفسك سالما وبروحك غانما قبل ان يصل اليك.
# فلم يعبا بكلامهن الا والفارس اقبل فلما رءا ظافر يخاطب الجوار غضب غضبا
~~شديدا وصاح به صيحة وقام عليه بحربة فخرج ابن الملك عن طريقها فصدفت حجرا
~~فشقته وغابت في الارض الى نصف العصا فعند ذلك تحاربا وتحاملا وتضاربا
~~بالسيوف حتى تفللت وبالرماح حتى تكسرت واشتد الحرب بينهما حتى ازبدت الخيل
~~عرقا وطارت قلقا ساعة من النهار واذا بابن الملك صاح بالفارس صيحة الغضب
~~ادهشه وارعبه وقام عليه بضربة براه بها كبري القلم.
[5.9]
# فخرجن اليه النسوة عند ذلك مسرعات وقلن له: من انت ايها البطل الذي ارحت
~~البلاد من هذا العدو والطاغي الجبار الباغي؟
# فقال لهن ظافر: وما كانت حرفته؟
# قلن: اذا سمع بجارية ذات حسن وجمال اختطفها من قصر ابيها وقد ضاق الارض شرا.
# قال: فعند ذلك ترجل ظافر عن جواده وقد استحرت عليه القايلة فدفع الجواد
~~الى احداهن فربطته ودخل القبة فوجدها مفروشة بالحرير والديباج المدثر فاخذه
~~النوم من شدة التعب فدعا باحد تلك الجوار وقال لها: ابسطي فخذك لكي انام عليها.
# ففعلت ونام الفتا.
[5.10]
# فلم يستيقض الا بحرارة الشمس من صبيحة غدا ففتح عينه فلم يجد للجوار خبر
~~ولا للقبة اثر فقام الى الجواد وشال عليه سرجه وتقلد بسيفه وركب وقال: لا
~~حول ولا قوة الا بالله العلي العظيم.
# ثم سار مع مهبط الواد ينظر يمينا وشمالا فلم يرا احد.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.
### || 5.3 الليلة التاسعة عشر

# [5.11]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك لما هبط الفتا مع الواد اذا اشرف على قصر عظيم مشيد
~~بناءه جديد واساسه حديد قد بنته والعمالقة والعبيد والبطارقة فتامل الى
~~القصر فرءا الى جانبه سبع قباب من الديباج المدثر فعبر الواد وسار نحو
~~القبة الاولى فرءا امام كل قبة جواد من عتاق الخيل مربوط وصارم معلق.
[5.12]
# فنادى: السلام عليكم يا اهل هذه القبة انا رجل غريب بعيد الديار ناوي
~~المزار.
# فما تم كلامه ولا فرغ من خطابه الا وابواب القبة قد فتحت وخرج اليه شاب
~~كانه غصن بان ام قضيب خزران فقال له: من انت يا هذا الذي اقتحمت بنفسك لجج
~~البحار وغمرات المنايا؟ اما سمعت بصاحب هذا القصر والواد؟
# فقال له ابن الملك: وما اسمه فيعرف وما كنيته فيوصف؟
# قال له: كيف يخفى عليك اسمه وهو بطل مشهور وسيد مذكور وهو السويدان بن
~~عامر ابن بدر السماء صاحب واد الدما وهو بطل شجاع.
[5.13]
# قال: فعطف عليه ابن الملك وقال له: يا شاب انتم من رجاله؟
# قال له: لا بل لنا قبله اثار وذلك انه اختطف لنا اختا من قصر ابينا ونحن
~~سبعة اخوة وابينا ملكا من الملوك صاحب قصر واموال وخرجنا لعلنا نظفر به
~~فقال لهم ابن الملك: يا اخوتي اني نريد ان ننزل معكم فاني رايت شيئا وركبت
~~جوادي وهربت كاني صعلوك من صعاليك العرب اصبح بارض وامسا باخرى.
# قالوا له: انزل معنا تاكل مما ناكلوه وتشرب مما نشربوه حتى يفعل الله ما
~~يشاء و @QUR@05 {يقضى الله أمرا كان مفعولا} .
[5.14]
# قال: فعند ذلك نزل ظافر على جواده وعقله ودخل القبة وجلس مع الاخوة يتحدث معهم.
# فبينما هم كذلك اذا سمعوا صيحة عظيمة استجاب لها القصر والواد فخرجوا
~~ينظرون واذا بباب القصر قد انفتح وخرج منه بطل كانه الطود الهايل ام اللجج
~~السايل وهو متكفن في الحديد الاشهب والزرد كما قال الشاعر:
# ومن خرج يلقا الممات وحوله %~% سمر الاسنة كالكواكب تلمع
# لبس الحديد على الحديد فخلته %~% قمرا بابواب الدجا يتطلع
# فاذا انثنى وحسامه في كفه %~% ليل لسان الصبح فيه يطلع
[5.15]
# قال: ثم ان الفارس جال في وسط الميدان وقال: يا معشر الفرسان هل من مبارز
~~يبارزني؟
# فبرز اليه احد الاخوة فقتله ثم برز اليه الثاني فقتله ثم برز اليه الثالث
~~فقتله ثم الرابع اعدمه الرجوع ثم الخامس عجل حتفه ثم السادس فجندله فبقا
~~السابع وهو اصغرهم فاراد الخروج اليه فمنعه ظافر وقال له: مهلا عليك يا
~~ابني فانك صغيرا لا تعرف الحروب.
# ثم انه تدرع والتثم وخرج واستوى على ظهر جواده وصاح بالفارس صيحة اهتزت
~~له الارض والجبال ثم تحاملا وتضاربا وتحاربا وحمل كل واحد منهما على صاحبه
~~وصار عليهما الغبار كالخباء المنصوب الى ان جن عليهم اليل وحال بينهما
~~الظلام فافترقا على سلامة.

~~فوجده باكيا حزينا على اخوته فقال له: لا باس عليك فاني اقسم عليك بفالق
~~الاصباح ومجري الرياح لاخذن لكم بالثار ولاكشفن عنكم العار ولاجعلنك تسير
~~بهذا البطل الذي قتل اخوتك وتحمله اسير الى بلاد ابيك.
# فباتا تلك الليلة يتحدثان فلما اصبح الله بخير الصباح لم يستيقض ابن
~~الملك الا لدوي الحافر فقام مرعوبا فازعا وخرج على باب القبة فوجد الصبي
~~مدبوحا وهو يتخبط في دمه فبهت ظافر بن لاحق طويلا وقال: لا حول ولا قوة الا
~~بالله العلي العظيم.
# ثم قام من ساعته وتدرع وركب جواده وضرب يده على قايم سيفه وخرج مسرعا
~~فوجد البطل صاحب القصر واقفا بازاء القبة.
[5.17]
# فلما ابصره البطل قال له: امن يطلب الثار ينام ويطمئن في القفار واقسم
~~برب الارباب لولا ان أخاف لن اعاير ما عشت ولا ساعة ولاكن افتح معي ميدان
~~الحرب فنقسم بما تقسم به الاشراف لاعرض عليك حربا يشيب منه الوليد ويتعجب
~~منه كل بطل صنديد.
# ثم حمل كل واحد منهما على صاحبه فتحاملا ميلا واعترك طويلا فلا تسمع
~~منهما الا الضرب على البيضات كانها المطارق على الزبرات ولا ترى للخيل الا

[5.18]
# فردها الى سرجها وقال لها: جارية ذات نهد وفرج وظلع اعوج تحارب الابطال؟

# قال لها: انا ظافر بن لاحق صاحب مداين الازهار وقصور النوار خرجت اجول في الارض.
# فقالت له: ابشر لقد اعطاك الله من الخير والمال والجوار ما لا يوصف.
# ثم اخذت بيده وقالت له: والله لقد علمت انك بطل شجاع ولا في الارض من

# فقال لها: وكيف تفردت بنفسك في هذا القصر؟
# قالت له: كان ابي بطل من الابطال ولم يكن له ولد ذكر فسماني السويدي بن
~~عامر على اسم رجل وعلمني ركوب الخيل وخوضان الليل والضرب بالحسام والطعن
~~بالسنان ومبارزة الاقران والفرسان فصرت كما ترى.
[5.19]
# ثم اخذت بيده وادخلته الى القصر فرءا من الاموال والدخاير وغير ذلك
~~واحتجب ابن الملك بتلك الجارية وزوجها ودخل بها فوجدها بكرا عذرا فبقا معها

### | 7 حديث الملك سليمان بن عبد الملك بن مروان

### || 7.1
[7.1]
# ثم قالت: زعموا ايها الملك ان سليمان لما اتى عليه من العمر سبعة اعوام نطق بالحكمة والشعر وجاء بكل معرفة وتعلم ركوب الخيل وخوضان اليل والطعن بالسنان والضرب بالحسام ومبارزة الابطال والفرسان الى ان خرج الى صيد الاسد فخرج ءاية من ءايات الله وعبرة من العبرات فلما بلغ من العمر ستة عشر سنة اتساع الباع واشتد الذراع ومع ذلك انه اجمل خلق الله صورة واكرمهم بنانا.
# فلما نظر اليه ابوه سر به سرورا عظيما وقال له: يا ابني تمنى علي ما شئت.
# قال له: يا ابت نريد ان تبن لي قصرا وتجري فيه الانهار.
# قال له: نعم لك ذلك.
[7.2]
# قال: فارسل الى امين البنايين فاجتمعوا اليه من الاقطار والامصار فبنوا له قصرا ما رات العيون مثله فلما تم له القصر من البنا صنع فيه مهرجانا عظيما واطعم فيه الناس حاضرة وبادية.
# قال: فبينما سليمان ذات يوم من الايام جالسا في قصره في كوكب رفيع ينظر الى صحن القصر ويتامل في بياض الرخام ويتعجب من ذالك واذا بغرابين يتضاربان حتى سقطا في وسط القصر وسالت منهما الدماء على بياض الرخام.
# فقال في نفسه: يا ليت شعري هل خلق الله تعلى جارية يكون بياض جسمها مثل هذا الرخام وسواد شعرها كسواد هذا الغراب وحمرة خديها مثل هذا الدم على الرخام؟
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.

# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك ان سليمان بن عبد الملك دعا باصحابه ووزرايه واعلمهم
~~بامره وما جرا في سره فقالوا له: ليس تجد مثل هذه الجارية الا عند ابي حزم.
# قال: فبعث سليمان اليه فلما اتاه اعلمه بالخبر.
# فقال له: ايها الملك انا اعرف جارية على هذه الصفة التي ذكرت وهي ابنت
~~ملك من الملوك وهي قد خفت عن الابصار وهي اجمل جوار الدنيا والسما اقرب
~~اليك من وصالها.
# قال له سليمان: ولم ذالك؟
[7.4]
# قال: لانها غليظة الحجاب ولابيها ملك شامخ يركب له من صيحة واحدة مائة
~~الف ضارب بالسيف ووالدها قد ولاها امرها بنفسها فلا تتزوج الا من تريده او
~~من يغلبها في ميدان الحرب وهي اكره خلق الله تعلى في الرجال في الحرب.
# قال: فعطف سليمان عليه وقال: يا ابي الحزم كيف الوصول اليها والاجتماع معها؟
# فقال له ابو الحزم: ارا لك من الراي ان تبعث لها هدية فان قبلتها فترجوا خيرا.
# قال له سليمان: ومن نبعث لها رسولا؟
# فقال له: ابعث لها ابي عبد الله بن بطال فهو اشجع الناس واحسنهم وجها
~~وكمالا وافصحهم لسانا.
[7.5]
# قال: وقد وقع في قلب سليمان من حب الجارية نارا لا يطفيها بسبعة البحر
~~فاحضر عبد الله بن بطال وقال له: السمع والطاعة لله ثم لك ايها الامير.
# قال: فامر له بجواد من عتاق الخيل وكتب الى ابيها كتابا يرغبه في مصاهرته
~~ثم بعث اليه هدية من الجوهر والياقوت والزمرد وحشيش الارض من الهند والف
~~نجيب والف عبد من اولاد النصرانية قد لبسوا الديباج وبايديهم الحروب الزرق
~~ودروق اللمط فلما اتم الهدية خرج سليمان مع اصحابه واوصا عبد الله وتودع
~~منه وسار يقطع الارض بالطول والعرض الى ان وصل الى مدينة نمارق خرج اليه
~~وصنع له بروزا عظيما وسلم عليه وقال له: من اين اقبلت والى اين تريد؟
[7.6]
# قال له: جئتك رسولا من عند امير المومنين عبد الملك بن مروان ومن عند
~~ابنه سليمان.
# قال له نمارق: اتهددني بعبد الملك وبابنه؟
# فقال له: ايها الملك انما جئتك في امر المصاهرة لتزوج ابنتك من ابنه.
# فقال له الملك: تكن من جنس ابنه؟ فاقسم بما تقسم به الاشراف لولا ان
~~الملوك لا ترضى بقتل الارسال لقتلتك ولاكن سر الى مولاك وقل له اني قادم
~~عليه في هذا العام المقبل بعشرة ءالاف بطل على عشرة ءالاف اشقر وعشرة ءالاف

~~الله بن بطال على حال سبيله.
# واتصل الخبر بالجارية فبعثت اليه الف فارس خلف عبد الله ان ياتوا به
~~اسيرا والا براسه قتيلا.
# قال: فلما نظر عبد الله الى الخيل في اثره لم يشك انه تنقض عليه فخرج عن
~~الطريق فلم يجدوا له خبر ولا وقفوا له على اثر فما زال يدور في تلك الارض
~~حتى وصل الى مدينة دمشق وكان سليمان في ذالك اليوم قد صعد من قصره في كوكب
~~فنظر الى عبد الله بن بطال وهو في سرعة عظيمة يسير حتى اتى الى القصر وصاح:
~~الغيث الغيث ايها الملك.
[7.8]
# فامر بدخوله فسلم عليه واعلمه بما اتفق عليه.
# فعند ذلك اعلم سليمان اباه بالخبر فقال له ابوه عبد الملك: ما الذي تريد نصنع؟
# فقال له: نسير اليه ولو كان في عدد مضر.
# قال: فامر له ابوه باربعين الف فارس مدرعة ممن يقطع الفيافي والقفار
~~واعطاهم السلاح وفرق عليهم الاموال ثم قدم عليهم سليمان والوليد ومسلمة
~~وتودع منهم وانصرف وسار يقطعون الارض بالطول والعرض والاجام والاكام والتلل
~~والرمال والاودية والاقطار مدة من ثلاثة ايام.
[7.9]
# فبينما هم في اليوم الرابع يمشون اذ قامت بين ايديهم ضبية فاراد سليمان
~~اقتناصها وسار في اثرها فلم يلحقها ورجع الى موضع جيشه فلم يجد لهم خبر ولا
~~وقع لهم على اثر.
# فبينما هو يلتفت يمينا وشمالا اذ رءا بالبعد شيئا يلمع كانه برق فقصد
~~نحوه فاذا بنهر خضير نظير المسك من حافته ينتشر ام سحيق العنبر قد مطر فلما
~~نظر سليمان الى الواد ونظر الى حسنه وجماله وقد اشتدت عليه القايلة والواد
~~في انحداره كانه تعبان انسلخ من جلده ام حسام تجرد من غمده فلما قرب من
~~النهر رءا اشجار ملتفة بالواد وثمار باسقات واطيار ناطقات وامياه رايقات.
[7.10]
# فاشتهت نفسه النزول على ذلك الواد فنزل عن جواده وانغمس في الواد وصب
~~الماء على جسده فسمع حسا فلبس ثيابه في الحين واستوى على متن جواده اذا نظر
~~الى اسد هايل مهول بسواعد شداد وانياب حداد قد خرج اليه من تلك الاشجار
~~فلما نظر اليه سليمان لم يتمالك نفسه الى ان صاح به صيحة عظيمة وحمل الاسد

# فلما اصبح الله بالصباح ركب جواده وصار يهيم كما تهيم النعايم في البرية حتى اشرف على ربوة فصعد عليها وتامل من خلفها واذا بواد كثير الثمار والاشجار فقصد نحوه وقد اشتد عليه حر الشمس فقرب من الواد ونزل عن جواده ليستضل بالاشجار.
# فبينما هو كذلك اذا كانت منه التفاتة فنظر الى جارية احسن خلق الله تعلى عليها اقبية الديباج وفي يديها طبق من الخزران وهي تقطف الازهار من اغصان الاشجار فلما رءاها عقل جواده وانسل اليها انسلال الظل وقبض عليها والقا سيفه في نحرها وقال لها: تكلمي من انت يا جارية؟

### | 10 حديث الفتا المصري مع ابنت عمه

### || 10.1
[10.1]
# قالت: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان فتى من بني الاعيان قد جمع النهاية في المال والغاية في الحسن والجمال وكان مولوعا بالادبا والمساكين ولا يخلوا مجلسه من الانعام وكان ابوه قد ترك له مالا فتزوج ابنت عمه وكان من مدينة مصر وكان قد بنا دارا على شاطى النيل فما كان على شاطى النيل اعلا منه يشرف على جميع ارضه وكان محبا في ابنة عمه فرزقه الله تعلى منها ولدا.
[10.2]
# وكان للفتا صاحبا له شريف فلما اتى على ابنه اربعة اعواما وكان الفتى جالسا ذات يوم في دكانه مع صاحبه الشريف اذا دفع له تفاحة عراقية فابا ان ياخذها الفتى وقال له: ما يحبس هذه التفاحة الا العشاق.
# واشتغل بالبيع والشرا وكان ابن التاجر قد اتى به الخادم الى ابيه فدفع الرجل الشريف التفاحة الى الولد وابوه لا يعلم بذلك فاخذ الصبي التفاحة وجعلها في جيبه وانصرف به الخادم الى الدار فلعب الصبي بالتفاحة ساعة ثم دفعها الى امه فاخذتها والقتها تحت الوسادة.
[10.3]
# فلما كان في الليل اتا الرجل التاجر فدخل فراشه لينام فحس تحت راسه ارتفاع فرفع الوسادة فوجد التفاحة فرفعها فقال في نفسه: هذه التفاحة التي دفع الي الشاب ولم اخدها منه.
# ثم قال: اواه انه مع امراتي كما قال الشاعر:
# وتفاحة لما هممت باكلها %~% وقدمت سكينا لاقسمها شطرا
# فشبهتها خد الحبيب وحسنه %~% فناولتها برا وقبلتها عشرا
# ثم قال: والله لا عشت بعد هذا ابدا.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.

# [10.4]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك لما كانت الليلة لما رءا التفاحة اخذها واخفاها ودعا
~~بابنة عميه وقال لها: اني اريد ان تفرش لي في الكوكب فاني اجد في نفسي غم
~~لعلي اتفرج في النيل.
# ففرشت له والجارية ليس لها علم بما اتفق وصاحب الغيب يدبر كيف شاء فطلعوا
~~الى الكوكب فطلع الفتى وفتح الطاقة وقال للجارية: اخرجي راسك وانظري.
# فخرجت راسها فرماها من رجلها في النيل.
[10.5]
# فكان من قضاء الله ان صيادا يصطاد تحت الكوكب فلما نزلت في الماء وذلك في
~~ظلمة اليل فرءا الصياد شيئا يتخبط في الماء فاخذ الجارية ورفعها في القارب
~~وسار بها الى موضعه وكان الصياد ساكنا على شاطى النيل بينه وبين المدينة
~~اثنى عشر ميلا وكان يواضب ذلك المكان لكثرة ما فيه من السمك.
# قال: فلما اصبح الصباح نزل الفتا عن الكوكب الى صحن الدار فوجد ابنه يبكي
~~فقال له: وما يبكيك؟
# فقال له: اني دفعت الى امي تفاحة الذي ءاعطاها الي عمي فلان في الحانوت
~~ولا علمت اين خبتها امي.
[10.6]
# فندم الفتى حيث لا ينفعه الندم وكتم الحال عن ولده وعن اهلها فبينما هو
~~ذات يوم جالس في السوق وهو مفكر فيما اتفق له اذا رءا حلة ابنت عميه في يد
~~الدلال فاخذها وقال للدلال: ايتني بصاحب هذه الحلة.
# فاتاه بالرجل الصياد فقال له: من اين لك هذه الحلة؟
# قال له: هي متاعي.
# قال له: اصدقني بالحق والخبر الصحيح وانا اعطيك الحلة وثمنها.
[10.7]
# فوصف له الخبر من اوله الى ءاخره فاضافه ثلاثة ايام ثم اخذ ثيابا ومطيته
~~وسار مع الصياد حتى وصلوا القرية فادخله الصياد الدار فرءا الجارية فتراما
~~عليها ووصف لها كيف اتفق له وقال لها: انما فعلت ذلك من الغيرة.
# قالت له: يا ابن العم عفا الله عما سلف.
# وبقا الفتا في ضيافة الصياد وبات تلك الليلة.
[10.8]
# فلما قرب الصباح عطف الفتا على الصياد وقال له: اني اريد الانصراف.
# فقال له الصياد: ان كنت عزمت على الانصراف فهذا الوقت خير لك لان العرب
~~يقطعون الطريق بالنهار.
# قال له: جزاك الله خيرا.

~~وبقا الفتا في الارض مغشيا عليه وكانت على راسه فوطة عراقية فاخذها احدهم
~~فتركوه وانصرفوا بالسلب والجارية وبقى الفتى مغشيا عليه حتى افاق فقام ينفض

[10.10]
# فرجع الى حانوته يبيع ويشتري ويتفكر في حال ابنت عمه فبينما هو ذات يوم

# فعطف الفتا على الاعرابي وقال له: تسير معي الى منزلي ادفع لك مالك
# قال له الاعرابي: جزاك الله عني خيرا.
[10.13]
# ثم قام وانطلق مع الاعرابي الى منزل الفتى فاتا به الى بيت في قعر الدار

### | 11 حديث الملك واولاده الثلاثة

### || 11.1
[11.1]
# ثم قالت: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان ملكا من الملوك قد ملك الارض بالطول والعرض وكانت له جيوش وقبايل وكان له ثلاثة اولاد.
# فلما كبر سنه وانحنى ظهره دعا بوزرايه وارباب دولته وقال لهم: ان اولادي قد كبروا فدلوني على ملك يكون له ثلاث بنات ازوجهن من اولادي.
# فقام اليه رجل منهم كبير السن ثم قال له: ايها الملك ان بارض الفرس ملكا له ثلاثة بنات اجمل نساء الدنيا.
[11.2]
# قال: فلما سمع الملك كلام الشيخ دعا باولاده فولا احدهم على المملكة وخرج للخطبة يقطع الارض بالطول والعرض حتى اشرف على ربوة عالية وفي وسطها مغارة وقد جن عليه اليل فقصد الى المغارة لينام فيها فلما قرب منها ترجل عن جواده وبسط حجفته ونام عليها فلم يستيقض الا واسد قد برك عليه فافترسه واكل جواده.
# فانتظروه اولاده الميعاد الذي وعدهم فلم يرجع فلما يئسوا منه اقبل بعضهم على بعض وتشاوروا في امره فقال الكبير: يا اخواتي ان ابانا قد انقطع خبره لاكن تولوا على المدينة من يقوم بها ونخرج في طلب ابينا لبلاد الفرس.
# فقالوا له: نعم الراي ما رايت.
[11.3]
# فلوا على البلاد من يحفظها وخرجوا الثلاثة على خيولهم وساروا يقطعون الارض بالطول والعرض.
# فلما جن اليل وقد قربوا المغارة التي اكل الاسد فيها والدهم فنزلوا عن خيلهم وقالوا: من يحرسنا في هذه الليلة؟
# فتقارعوا فخرجت القرعة على اكبرهم.
# فلما ناموا اخوته ضرب يده على قايم سيفه وصار يدور بالمغارة يحرسهم فبينما هو كذلك واذا بالاسد اقبل كالطود الهايل فلما رءاه ابن الملك قد قصد نحوه واراد افتراسه فراغ الفتا عنه الى الناحية الاخرى واقام عليه بضربة براه بها كبري القلم واخذ راس الاسد القاه في وعاية وبقا الاسد في الناحية الاخرى واحرص اخوته الى الصبح.

[12.1]
# ثم قالت المحدثة: زعموا ايها الملك والله اعلم انه كان ببغداد فتا من ابناء التجار فمات والده وترك له مالا كثيرا فما زال ياكل ويشرب حتى لم يبق له شيئا لا دينار ولا درهم.
# فلما بقا اصفر اليدين قصد اصحابه الذي كان ينادمهم فطردوه وانكروه فرجع الفتا الى امه فاعلمها بالخبر فقالت له: والله يا بني لقد خشيت عليك هذا ولاكن ما بقا لي دينار ولا درهم الا هذا البساط الذي نناموا عليه.
[12.2]
# فدفعته له وسار به الى السوق فباعه بدينار فقبضه وسار يريد منزله واذا بسمسار ينادي وهو يقول: من يشتري مني ما يغنيه من ليلته؟
# فلما سمع الفتا ذلك قرب منه وقال: وما ذلك؟
# فاخرج له سكينا كبيرا وكان اسم الفتا علي بن عبد الرحمان البزاري فاخذ السكين ودفع له الدينار وانصرف الى منزله فقالت له امه: ما الذي صنعت بثمن البساط؟
# فاعلمها انه اشترا به سكينا فقالت له: ما الذي تصنع به؟
# قال لها: سمعت السمسار وهو يقول: من يشتري ما يغنيه من ليلته فاشتريته منه.
[12.3]
# فبقا الفتى حتى جن اليل اخذ السكين بيده وخرج في ظلام اليل واليل قد ارخا استاره فما زال يمشى في ازقة المدينة حتى وصل الى قصر المامون فقصد الى الباب فوجده مفتوحا والحراس نيام فقال في نفسه: في هذه الليلة اما استغنى واما نموت.
# ثم انه دخل على باب القصر وبقي يسير من فصيل الى فصيل حتى انفتح له الضيا عن مجالس مرتفعات وبين المجالس بستان مليح قد غرست فيه جميع الاثمار وفي وسط البستان ناعورة فلكية قد صنعت من العود الرطب مصفحة بالذهب الوهاج ترفع الماء على اعلاها وتصبه في اسفلها كما قال الشاعر:
# ومدارة بكأت فمثلي تبكي %~% مثل مدامع العشاق
# تبح الانين كانها مفجوعة %~% بحبيبها او رايع الفراق
# قال: والبستان قد دارت به قباب الصندل وعلى اعلى البستان شبايك من حديد والطير يتسرح بين الاشجار.

~~القصر فاخترق المقاصير حتى وصل الى مقصورة فشم فيها رايحة الطعام وكان قد
~~اصابه الجوع فقصد اليها فوجد فيها طعاما وخبز درمك فاكل من ذلك الطعام.
# فبينما هو ياكل اذا سمع حسا خلفه فالتفت فرءا اسود وبيده سيف مسلول وبيده
~~الاخرى في شعر جارية كانها البدر الطالع ام الغزال الراتع والعبد يقودها من
~~ورايه حتى ادخلها المقصورة وضربها الى الارض وجلس على تابوت صدرها وقال
~~لها: ان لم تمكنني من نفسك لا عشت بعد هذه الليلة ابدا.
# فقالت له: والله لا كان ذلك ابدا ولو قرضتني بالمقاريض يا عبد السوء لا
~~قربت لي موضعا يقربه امير المومنين.

# فهم العبد بقتلها فوثب عليه الفتى وضربه بالسكين الذي كان بيده بين
~~الكتفين حتى اخرجه من صدره فسقط في الارض ميتا.
# فلما رات الجارية ذلك قامت وترامت عليه وقالت له: من انت الذي من الله
~~علي بك؟ انس ام جن؟
# قال لها: بل انا من الانس دخلت هذا القصر متلصص وما انا بلص بعثني الله

# ثم قالت: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان في زمن هارون الرشيد اربعة اصحاب احدهم سارق والثاني يقص الاثر والثالث نجار والرابع راميا.
# قال فدخلوا الى مدينة بغداد ونزلوا في دار واحدة غير ان ديار بغداد عليها شبايك الحديد فلما دخلوا الدار وجن عليهم اليل وبين ايديهم طعام وشراب اذا سقط عليهم الشبايك فقاموا من حينهم ونظروا ما الخبر فنظروا الى جارية كانها البدر الطالع.
[13.2]
# فقالوا لها: من انت يا جارية؟
# فلم تجبهم فعطف بعضهم على بعض وقال كل واحد: انا اخذها.

# فقال كبيرهم: اسمعوا مني.
# قالوا: نعم.
# فقال لهم: اتركوا الجارية في بيت من البيوت واغلقوا عليها بالقفل الى
~~صبيحة غدا ان شاء الله فمن كان منكم اصنع من صاحبه واعرف هي له.
# قالوا: نعم الراي هذا.
[13.4]
# فاخذوا الجارية والقوها في بيت وغلقوه بقفل وباتوا تلك الليلة فلما اصبح
~~الصباح فتحوا الباب وطلبوا الجارية فلم يجدوا لها خبر فقال لهم القصاص: انا

# فنظر ساعة ثم قال: هذه الجارية اختطفها عفريتا من الجن ولو اختطفها انس
~~لرايت اثره ولاكن اتبعوني حتى اريكم فوالله لو صعدت مصعد الشمس او غابت
~~مغيب الرمس لابد لي منها ثم سار القصاص يقص الاثر بهم حتى انتهى بهم الى
~~شاطى البحر.
# فقال لهم: على هذا البحر سارت.
[13.5]
# قال: فعند ذلك عطفوا على النجار وقالوا له: اين ما كنت تدعي من صناعتك؟
# قال لهم: نعم.

# قال لهم: نعم.
# فاتى الى الغار فوجد الجارية على حالها فتحيل حتى نزل راس العفريت عن

# فقالوا للرامي: اين ما كنت تدعي من صناعتك.

# ثم اخذ سهما ولقاه في قوسه ورما به فقتله فاسقط في البحر ميتا.

# ثم قالت: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان ملكا من الملوك يقال له سيف الاعلام وكان مطاع وبطل شجاع تهابه الملوك الاكابر وتخضع اليه الملوك الاصاغر وكان الملك سيف الاعلام لا يزداد عنده ولد ذكر ابدا فحزن لذلك وجمع الاطباء والمنجمين والحكما فحسبوا له القرعة وخط الرمل ونظروا في النجوم وقالوا له: ايها الملك سيكون لك مولود ذكر تسر به عن قريب ياتيك ان شاء الله.
[14.2]
# قال: فبقا الملك يتغدا باحسن الغدا حتى ازداد له ولد ذكر لم يكن في زمانه اجمل منه فصنع مهرجانا عظيما اكل الناس فيه حاضرة وبادية ثم دعى بالمنجمين وقال لهم: انظروا في طالع ابني هذا وما يوافقه من الازمنة.
# فنظر كل واحد منهم في علمه وقالوا له: ايها الملك ان ابنك هذا يكون طويل العمر غير انه يصيبه عند كمال عشرين سنة امر هايل ويخاف عليه القتل.
# فتعجب الملك مما اخبروه.

# فلما رءا الملك حال ابنه كبر عليه امره وبعث الى علماء كل بلدة فاتوا
~~باجمعهم فقال لهم: انظروا ماذا ترون في حال ابني هل فيكم من يستطيع ان
~~يعلمه واعطيه من المال والدخاير ما يحب.
# وكان عدد العلماء الف عالم فقام منهم اربعة وقال كل واحد: انا اعلمه ايها الملك.
[14.4]
# ثم قام سندباد وهو معلمه الاول قال: انا اعلمه ايها الملك ما لا يقدروا
~~هولاء تعليمه.
# ثم انه عطف على العلماء وقال لهم: كيف اردتم ان تعلموه؟
# فاخبره كل واحد منهم بالذي اراد ان يعلمه فقال لهم سندباد: غير هذا؟ فاني
~~قد علمته هذا فلم يتعلم شيئا وقد كنت اظن ان لا يكون احدا اعلم مني منكم

# فلما سمع الملك ذلك دعا بسندباد وقال له: فيما تعلمه انت؟
# قال: في نصف سنة حتى لا يكون احدا اعلم منه في زمانه وان لم افعل ذلك فقد
~~حال مالي ودمي.
[14.9]
# ثم قال سندباد للملك: ان الارض اذا لم يكن فيها ملك ولا عالم ولا تاجر
~~ولا طبيب فلا ينبغي لاحد ان يسكنها وكلما ذكرت بارضك والحمد لله وقد اخبرت
~~ايها الملك ان الملوك كالنار اذا تباعدت منها سلمت واذا اقربت منها احرقتك

# قال: لا تفعل بغيرك ما تكرهه لنفسك.

~~في هذا الموضع.
# ثم جلس معه يعلمه ويؤذبه ويوتي لهما بطعامهما وشرابهما وما يحتاج اليه.
# فلما تم الامد تعلم الغلام كلما علمه سندباد فاعلم الملك بذلك فسر سرورا

~~لمعلمه: فما ترا ان اصنع فامرني بما شئت.
# قال له: قد وعدت ابيك ان ءاتيك اليه غدا وليس لي مخالفة.
# فلما كان في الغدا ومضا من النهار ساعتين قال له: ادهب الى ابيك وحدك ولا

[15.1]
# ثم قالت: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان في الزمان الاول ملكا وكانت له ابل وغنم وبقر وكانت له رمكة لم يكن في ذالك الزمان املح منها وكان لها فصيل مليح وكان ذالك الفصيل يدور بتلك الاغنام والابقار فكان الملك يحبه حبا شديدا وكان اذا اراد النزاهة يخرج راكبا على رمكته وينظر الى الفصيل وحسنه ولا يقدر احدا ان يتجرا على تلك الاغنام والابقار مخافة من الفصيل.
[15.2]
# فلما كان يوم من الايام هاج الفصيل وهرب الى البرية فتبعته تلك الاغنام والابقار والابل. فلما رءا الملك ذلك ركب في بني عمه وجيشه وكانوا نحو من اربعين الف فارس فلم يلحقوا من الفصيل الا الغبار.
# فرجع الملك الى الحي وهو مهموم فنادى في قبايل العرب: من ياتيني بخبر الفصيل اعطيته الف وقية من الذهب الاحمر والف ناقة.

# قال لهما: واين رايتهم؟
# قالا: في جبل الثعبان وهو جبل كثير الاشجار والثمار وجميع بهايمك معه وهو
~~يدور بهم ويحرسهم وقد هلك الحرث والنسل.
[15.4]
# فقال لهما: ان كان ما تقولان حقا فلكما عندي ما شرطت على نفسي.
# قالا له: نسير معك على شرط.
# قال لهما: وما هو الشرط؟
# قالا له: اذا قربنا من الجبل اريناك فصيلك ورجعنا عنك.
# فقال لهما: نعم.
[15.5]
# ثم ان الملك دفع لهما ما شرط على نفسه وركب رمكته واخذ قناته بيده وسار

# ثم انصرفا عنه فلما قرب منه الملك ابصر فصيله والماشية حوله فصاح الملك
~~وصهلت رمكته من تحته فلما سمع الفصيل صياحهما اقبل الى الملك فاتح فاه
~~وعيناه تبرقا فلما قرب من الملك حمل عليه واراد ان يهلكه فهرب الملك منه

[16.1]
# قالت الجارية: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان ملكا من الملوك قد ملك الارض بالطول والعرض وكان حسن السيرة في رعيته وكانت العرب والعجم تخافوه وتهابوه وتهاديه فمهدت له البلاد وذلت له العباد وكان ذا ادب وبلاغة محبا لاهل العلم مقربا لاهل الفهم فاجتمعت عنده العلماء والحكما ما لم يجتمع عند الملوك قبله.
[16.2]
# وكان له عيدين في العام عيد السرور وعيد المهرجان فاذا كان في اخر العيد جلس الى الناس كافة ويفتح باب قصره ويدخل اليه الخاصة والعامة وترفع اليه الحوايج فاذا دخلوا عليه يحيونه بتحية الملوك ويهدي كل واحد منهم على قدر حاله فيقبلها منهم وترفع الى خزانته ويعطي لكل واحد منهم مجازاته وكان احب ما يهدي اليه شيء تكون فيه حكمة.

# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي فلما كان عيد من الاعياد دخلوا عليه ثلاثة من الحكما
~~احدهم هندي والثاني رومي والثالث فارسي وكان لكل واحد منهم من المال ما
~~يحمله ظهور الجمال.
[16.4]
# قال: فاقبل كل واحد منهم بهدية عظيمة وحكمة صنعها وكان من سيرة هذا الملك
~~اذا اهدي اليه شيء ويعجبه يعطي لصاحبه امنيته ويقضي حاجته في جميع مطلبه.
# قال: فامر الملك بدخول هؤلاء الحكماء واول من تقدم اليه الهندي الذي اهدى
~~له طلسما من النحاس في سورة رجل وفي فمه بوق يمسكه بيده وينفخ فيه فلما
~~رءاه الملك اعجبه فقال له: ايها الحكيم الفاضل ما يصنع هذا الطلسم بهذا
~~البوق الذي في فيه؟
# وكان قد صنعه بحكمة ضريفة فقال له: ايها الملك هذا الطلسم تجعله على باب
~~المدينة لا يدخلوها جاسوسا ولا عدو ولا طالب شر الا بوق في ذلك البوق فعند
~~ذلك تعلم به فتصنع به ما تريد.
[16.5]
# قال: فلما سمع الملك بذلك سر به سرورا عظيما ثم امر برفعه الى يوم
~~الاستخبار وهو يوم الثلاث من عيده وكانت عادته اذا كان يوم الاستخبار ان
~~يخرج كلما يهدى اليه ويستخبره فاذا وجده حقا خلع على صاحبه ويحسن اليه كل
~~الاحسان.
# قال: ثم امر بدخول الحكيم الثاني وهو الرومي فدخل ثم وضع بين يدي الملك
~~طسة من الذهب الاحمر وفي وسطها طاوس وحولها اثنى عشر فرخا من الطواويس في
~~احسن صورة واملح خلقة فلما نظر الملك ذلك اعجبه واستحسنه فقال له: ايها
~~الحكيم الفاضل ما حكمة هذه الطواويس؟
[16.6]
# قال له: ايها الملك تضعهم بين يديك فاذا مرت ساعة من النهار طار فرخا من
~~تلك الافراخ فما يزالوا يطيرون في انقضاء كل ساعة فرخا بعد فرخ حتى يتم
~~النهار فاذا جاء اليل ومضت منه ساعة ينزل فرخا من تلك الفراخ فما يزال
~~ينزلون في انقضاء كل ساعة حتى يتم اليل فاذا تم النهار يصفر تلك الطاوس
~~وكذلك عند تمام اليل فاذا كان عند انقضاء الشهر صفر تصفيرة كبيرة ويفتح فاه
~~فترا الهلال في فمه فتعلم ان تلك الليلة ليلة الشهر القابل.
# فقال له الملك: ان كان ما تقول حقا وظهر ما ذكرت بلغتك افضل الامال.

# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي لما رفع الطاوس امر الملك بدخول الحكيم الثالث وهو
~~الفارسي وكان رجلا كبير السن قبيح المنظر فدخل على الملك وسلم عليه ووضع
~~بين يديه فرسا من الابنوس وعليه سرج من الذهب ولجامه من الدر والياقوت لم

# قال: فتعجب الملك من ذلك وكل من كان معه في المجلس امتلا قلب الملك سرورا
~~وفرحا ثم قال له: ايها الحكيم الفاضل ما معجزة هذا الفرس التي لم ترا عيني مثلها.
# فقال له الحكيم: ايد الله الملك السعيد ان لهذا الفرس الذي ترا شانا
~~عظيما وذلك انه يسير براكبه في اليوم والليلة ما يسير فيه الفارس السريع في
~~سنة كاملة.
# فلما سمع الملك بذلك قال له: ان كان ما تقول حقا فلك عندي ما تشا.
# ثم امر الملك برفع الفرس الى خزانته ليوم الاستخبار ثم خرجوا الحكماء
~~الثلاثة من عند الملك وقد وعدهم بالجزايات الحسان.
[16.8]
# فلما كان في اليوم جلس الملك على سرير ملكه ووضع تاجا على راسه وامر
~~باحضار وزرايه وارباب دولته فحضروا بين يديه وجلسوا من حوله ثم امر باحضار
~~الحكماء الثلاثة فاقبلوا اليه ودخلوا عليه ثم امر باخراج الطلسم والطاوس
~~والفرس.
# وقال للحكماء: ان كنتم صدقتم فيما قلتم فلكل واحد منكم ما يتمنى.
# قال: فعند ذلك امر الملك بابتداء الطلسم صاحب البوق فاستخبره فوجده كما
~~وصف الحكيم فسر بذلك سرورا عظيما ثم قال الملك للحكيم: تمنى علي ما شئت.
# فقال له الحكيم: ايها الملك اتمنا عليك ان تزوجني ابنتك الكبيرة حتى اكون
~~لك صهرا.
# فقال له الملك: نعم لك ذلك.
[16.9]
# قال: وكان للملك ثلاثة بنات وغلام وكن بناته في ذلك الوقت خلف ستر مضروب
~~لهن يرين ما يجري بين يدي ابيهن.
# قال: فلما رات الكبيرة ذلك فرحت بتزويجها الى الحكيم لضرفه واذبه وعقله

# قال: ايها الملك اتمنى عليك ان تنعم علي كما انعمت على صاحبي وتزوجني
~~ابنتك الوسطى.
# قال: فاجابه الى ذلك فلما نظرت ابنت الملك الى ذلك سرت سرورا عظيما لما

# قال: ثم تقدم الحكيم الثالث وهو الفارسي صاحب الفرس وقبل الارض بين يدي
~~الملك فاحضر الفرس وفقال له الملك: ايها الحكيم الفاضل اني اريد انظر كيف
~~تسير هذه الفرس براكبها كما ذكرت.
# فقال له: نعم ايها الملك.
# ثم انه وثب عليها الحكيم ومد يده وحرك لولب الصعود وكان لهذا لولب في
~~اليسرى للنزول ولولب في اليمين للصعود قال: فلما حرك اللولب تحرك الفرس
~~ودخل الريح في جوفه حتى صعد في الهوى وكان هذا الفرس كلما امتلا جوفه ريحا
~~زاد علوا في الهوى ثم انه حرك اللولب الثاني وهو لولب النزول فلما نزل بين
~~يدي الملك سر بذلك سرورا عظيما وقال له:
[16.11]
# لله درك من حكيم لقد احكمت فيما صنعت تمنى علي بحاجتك فانك اتيتني بشيء
~~ما سبقك احدا قبلك.
# قال له: اعزك الله اتمنا عليك بان تلحقني باصحابي وتزوجني بابنتك الصغيرة

[16.13]
# قال: فدخل عليها اخوها فرءاها على تلك الحالة وكان محبا لها فقال لها: يا

# قال: فتقدم الفتى الى الفرس واستوى على سرجه وحركه فلم يتحرك وركضه برجله
~~فلم يضطرب فلما نظر ابن الملك الى ذلك قال لهم: ليس له حركة ولا نهضة.
# قال: فقام الحكيم وتقدم الى الفرس وحرك لولب الصعود فتحرك الفرس فلما نظر
~~ابن الملك الى اللولب ادخله العجب وفلم يسئل الحكيم عن لولب النزول ونسي
~~الحكيم ان يريه اللولب لما كان فيه من الغظب.
# قال: فحرك ابن الملك اللولب الصعود فهاج به الفرس واضطرب وامتلا جوفه

# قال له: هيهات لن تراه ابدا.
[16.15]
# قال له: وكيف ذلك؟
# قال له الحكيم: لان ابنك دخله العجب والعجلة ولم يسلني عن حركة النزول
~~فانه لا يزال صاعدا في الهوا حتى تعصف عليه الرياح وترميه فيهلك او يلهمه
~~الله تعلى الى لولب الانحطاط فيسلم.
# قال: فلما سمع الملك كلام الحكيم تغير وجهه ورمى التاج من على راسه وخر
~~مغشيا عليه فنضحوا الماء عليه وعلى وجهه فلما افاق امر بالحكيم الى السجن
~~فسجنه فلما يئس من ابنه حزن ولبس الصوف وامتنع من الطعام والشراب.
[16.16]
# واما ابن الملك لما رءا روحه صاعدا في الهوى ندم على ذلك وعلم ان الفرس
~~لا ينزل الا بحركة فجعل يفتش الفرس فنظر الى لولب صغير في جنبه الايسر
~~فحركه فنقص ارتفاعه ثم حرك اللولب الاول فزاد ارتفاعا فعلم ان الايسر

# ثم ان الفرس نزل به في سطح قصر ما رات العيون اجمل منه ففكر في نفسه وقال:
# ياليت شعري لمن يكون هذا القصر.
# ثم جعل يطوف يمينا وشمالا وقال في نفسه: لا اجد مكانا احسن من هذا الموضع

### | 17 حديث الملك والغزالة

### || 17.1
[17.1]
# ثم قالت الجارية: زعموا ايها الملك انه كان ملكا من الملوك ركب ذات يوم من الايام الى الصيد والقنص وزراؤه وارباب دولته فبينما هو يسير في البرية اذا قامت امام القوم غزالة حسنة الصورة وفي عناقها قلادة جوهر وفي ايديها اسورة من ذهب وخلاخل من فضة وعليها حلال من الديباج الاخضر فلما نظر الملك الى حسنها وجمالها قال لوزرايه: اني لا اظن هذه الغزالة الا لبعض الملوك واياك ان تفوتنا.
# ثم انهم اطلقوا الكلاب والبيزان في اثرها فكانوا اذا وصلوا اليها الكلاب جفوا عنها فلم يقربها فتعجب الملك من ذالك وقال الملك للوزير: خذ لنا عن اثرها فلعلنا نظفر بها.
# قال: فاخذوا في اثرها وهي تزداد جريا امامهم.
[17.2]
# قال: فلم يزالوا كذلك في اثرها الى اخر النهار حتى اتت بهم الى مرج عظيم كثير الثمار والاشجار وفيه ابل وبقر وغنم ترعى وفي وسط المرج قصر عظيم لم يرا الراءون مثله ولا اعظم منه.
# فلما وصلوا الى القصر وقف الملك والوزير ينظر الى حسنه وجماله فبينما هم كذلك اذا بشاب قد خرج من باب القصر على جواد من عتاق الخيل وعليه ثياب خضر.
[17.3]
# قال: فلما رات الغزالة الفتى جمعت قوايمها ووثبت معه في السرج فغطها بكمه وادخل بها الى القصر فتعجب الملك من ذلك ثم قال الوزير للملك: ايها الملك ما اظن هذه الغزالة الا لهذا الفتى فان رغبت ان استاذنوه في بيعها منك او بهديها لك.
# قال له: نعم.
# ثم ان الوزير والملك اقبلا حتى وصلا الى باب القصر واستذنوا في الدخول فساروا العبيد الى مولاهم صاحب القصر وقالوا له: ان في الباب رجلين وما اظنهما الا من ابناء الملوك يريدون الدخول عليك.
# قال لهم: ادخلوهم علي.
[17.4]
# قال: فادخلوهم الى القصر.
# قال: فنظر الملك يمينا وشمالا فلم يرا لها خبر ولا وقع لها على اثر.
# قال: فلما استقر بهما الجلوس احضرت بين يديهما موايد الطعام عليها صحايف الذهب ومنها انواع الاطعمة فاكلوا ثم اقبلوا على الشراب فلما اخذ الشراب في الملك قال للفتى صاحب القصر: قد وجب عليك اكرامنا ولي اليك حاجة.
# فقال له الفتى: ايها الملك القصر لك بما فيه وكل حاجة لك مقضية عندي.
# فقال الملك للفتى: حاجتي عندك ان تهدي لي الغزالة او تبعها مني.
# فقال له الفتى: اصلح الله الملك ما هي بغزالة وانما هي زوجتي.
# فقال له الملك: هذا عجب العجايب.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.
### || 17.2 الليلة السادسة والتسعون

# [17.5]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي لما تعجب الملك من قول الفتى قام الفتى من ساعته وغاب
~~ساعة ثم رجع والغزالة باثره فقال لها الفتى: بحق الذي وهب لك الاستطاعة الى
~~ما رجعت الى صورتك الذي خلقك الله عليها.
# فما استتم كلامه حتى انتفضت الغزالة ورجعت جارية اجمل خلق الله.
# قال: فلما رءا الملك ذلك بهت من حسنها وجمالها فقال الملك للفتى: هل لك
~~في بيعها وتحكم علي بثمنها ما شئيت.
# فقال له الفتى: وكيف ابيع زوجتي ولي منها ولدان؟ وفي قصتها اعجب العجايب
~~لمن يسمعها.
# فقال الملك: اني احب ان اسمع ذلك.
# فقال له: نعم ايها الملك:
[17.6]
# وذلك اني كنت من اهل الشام وكان ابي كثير المال والخير ولم يكن له ولدا
~~غيري فعلمني القرءان والنحو والعلم حتى كنت عالما وكان قد اختار لي عالما
~~معلما من اعلم الناس واكيسهم وافضلهم فلما رءا المعلم فهمي وما حزت من
~~العلم قال: اني قد علمتك بما عندي من العلم وما بقا لي غير حرز واحد وهو
~~حرز عظيم اكتبه لك فانه حصن لك من الانس والجن والشياطين.
# فقلت له: يا سيدي افعل.
[17.7]
# فكتبه لي في صحيفة من الذهب وامرني ان اعلقه على عضدي الايمن فعلقته علي
~~ثم انه مات رحمه الله تعلى وانا قد بلغت مبلغ الرجال فاشتغلت بركوب الخيل
~~وخوضان اليل حتى صرت فارسا شجاعا فلما ان كبر ابي وشاخ قال: يا ابني اني
~~اريد ان ازوجك في حياتي بابنة عمك.
# فقلت له: افعل ما شيت.
# فصنع لي وليمة عظيمة ودخلت بالجارية ابنة عمي فبينما انا ذات يوم جالس في
~~اعلى قصري اذا نظرت الى فارس عليه ذرع وسلاح فاقبل علي واستاذن فامرت
~~بنزوله وامرت له بطعام وشراب فاكل ما يحتاج اليه وتانست به وسالته على
~~بلاده فقال لي: انا من البصرة.
[17.8]
# فاقام عندي عشرة ايام فجعل يحدثني عن البصرة ويشوقني اليها ثم بعد ذلك
~~قال لي: اني اريد الرحلة الى البصرة والانصراف.
# فقلت له: يشق علي فراقك.
# فبتنا تلك الليلة وهو يحدثني على البصرة فلما اصبح الله بالصباح جهزته
~~وتودعت منه وانصرف يجد السير الى بلاده ثم بقيت متفكرا فيما وصف لي من حديث
~~البصرة فوصفت ذلك لابنة عمي فوقع في قلبها حب البصرة لما سمعت من جميع
~~شانها فقالت لي: يا ابن العم خذ على نفسك ترحل البصرة ولا بد منها ان شاء
~~الله تعلى.
# فبعت جميع املاكي وخرجت ماشيا الى ان وصلت الى البصرة فنزلت في دار من
~~ديارها واقمت بها اياما.
# فبينما انا ذات يوم من الايام جالس اذا بالباب يدق فخرجت فاذا انا بفتى
~~جميل الوجه في الباب فقال لي: اتعرفني؟
# قلت: لا.
[17.9]
# قال: انا الذي انزلتني في كرامتك.
# فعرفته فسلمت عليه وسلم علي ثم قال لي: سر معي.
# فسرت معه الى قصر عظيم واذا فيه جماعة قال لهم: هذا هو الذي حدثتكم عنه.
# فقاموا الي اجلالا ورحبوا بي ثم انزلوني في احسن مكان ثم قدم الينا طعاما
~~فاكلنا جميعا وشربنا الى اخر النهار ثم رجعت الى منزلي وبقيت مع الفتى كذلك
~~كل يوم مدة من شهرين كاملين.

~~وقالت: خود هذا السيف.
# فاخذت السيف ودخلت على العفريت وضربته في نحره ضربة عظيمة فمات من ساعته.
# ثم ساقت لي جميع ما في القصر من الحلي والحلل وغير ذلك وخرجت من السرب
~~الذي دخلت منه الى البير وحركت الحبل فرفعوا جميع ما كان في القصر والجوار

~~بعده مدة من الزمان حتى ثقلت علي تلك الجزيرة فوليت على الملك غيري ورجعت

### | 18 حديث الوزير بن ابي القمر مع عبد الملك بن مروان رحمهم الله

### || 18.1
[18.1]
# قالت الجارية: زعموا ايها الملك المطاع والبطل الشجاع انه كان امير المومنين عبد الملك بن مروان وزيره وكان اسمه ابن ابي القمر وكان رجلا فاطنا عالم بكل علم وكان عند الملك بمرتبة عظيمة فحسدوه بنوا امية ورفعوا عليه الكلام القبيح والنقايص الى الملك فلم يقبل الملك منهم شيء من ذلك الى ان صنعوا عليه عقدا مدلسا بانه يريد القيام على الملك وشهدوا فيه اعدل اهل البلاد فلما وصل العقد الى الملك وقراه تغير لونه ولم يجد لذلك صبرا فقال لاحد عبيده: اذا اتى الوزير بن ابي القمر غدا راكبا فجردوه من ثيابه واكسيته وقل له: يقول لك الملك ان وج دتك بموضع من ارضي قتلتك وصلبتك فان كنت بريا بارك الله وان كنت ظالما اهلكك الله.
[18.2]
# قال: فلما صبح الله الصباح اقبل الوزير على عادته فتلقته العبيد وفعلوا به ما امرهم الملك فقال الوزير في نفسه: يا ليت شعري ما الذي جنيت واذنبت.
# ثم خرج من البلاد وسار وهو لا يدري اين يتوجه وقد دخله رعبا عظيما فصار يمشي هايما بنفسه وكان فصل الشتا فما زال يمشي الى ان وصل الى مدينة فدخلها وكان عشية النهار وقد ادركه الجوع والبرد مع شدة الرعب والخوف والتعب وقد اشرف على الهلاك فقصد الى فندق التجار وكان فيه بضايع واعيان الناس واموالهم فبقا حايرا لا يدري ما يصنع فقال لقايم الفندق: عسى عندك بيتا ابيت فيها الليلة؟
[18.3]
# قال له: والله لا يبيت عندي صعلوكا فقيرا لان هذا الفندق فيه بضايع واموال التجار ولا ءامن على نفسي.
# قال: فبقا الوزير حايرا لا يدري ما يصنع ثم قام اليه رجلا من التجار وقال: يا قايم هذا الفندق اعطيه بيتا يبيت فيه الليلة وهو في ضمانتي.
# فادخله القايم الى بيت جديدة مسطحة فدخل الوزير في البيت والبيت دون حصير فاراد الجلوس فلم يستطع من شدة البرد فاراد ان يستند ظهره الى الحايط فلم يقدر من شدة برد الحيط فتحير الوزير واليل قد ارخا سدوله والناس قد اغلقوا ابوابهم فمنهم من يقرا في بيته ومنهم من ينشد والوزير يقول: @QUR@05 {إنا لله وإنآ إله راجعون} بئس ما فعلت بنفسي هل لا اويت الى قبة فرن ابيت فيها الليلة؟
[18.4]
# ثم انه فكر في حاله وبما كان فيه من النعم وكيف بدلت له نقم فجعل يتمثل بهذ الابيات:
# فلو كان الموت يباع فاشتريه %~% فهذا العيش ما لا خير فيه
# تراني كلما ابصرت قبرا %~% وددت بابي الملحود فيه
# الا ارحم الهيمان اخرى %~% تصدق بالممات على اجيه
# قال: فلما فرغ من انشاد شعره واذا بالباب قد نقر عليه وهو حاير فقام من ساعته وفتح الباب واذا بالرجل الذي ظمنه فدخل عليه بمصباح نحاس فركزه في الحايط وبمجمار بنار وكسا وملحفة مليحة واثواب وصفرة بالطعام وماء فنزع عنه العباء والبسه الثياب واطعمه واسقاه حتى شدت نفسه وزال عنه ما كان من الجهد والتعب ولم يزل التاجر يلاطفه ويحدثه ويؤنسه ويقول له: ما قصتك وما حديثك يا اخي فانه يظهر من شعرك انك قريح القلب.
# قال له الوزير: يا اخي لاقولن كما قال يعقوب عليه السلام @QUR@06 {إنمآ أشكو بثى وحزنى إلى الله} .
[18.5]
# قال: فلم يزل التاجر يلاطفه فلم يقدر عليه ان يخبره خوفا من الملك فاشفق عليه التاجر وقال له: ان لي اربع بنات ولي راس مال بالف دينار فالنصف لي والنصف الاخر اني عاهدت الله الا ادفعها الا في مرضاته واني لا اجد احد اولا بها منك فخدها بارك الله لك فيها.
# فقال له الوزير: لا اقبل ذالك.
# فقال له التاجر: فعسى نصفها.
# فامتنع الوزير عن اخدها ولم يزل التاجر يلح عليه حتى اخذ منها دينار واحد.
# قال: فلما اصبح الله الصباح قال الوزير للتاجر: وضع الله فيك البركة وشكرك على ما فعلت معي.
# ومشا التاجر الى بيته بعدما ودع الوزير ودعا له وبقا الوزير وحده.
[18.6]
# فلم يزل مفكرا في نفسه فبينما هو كذلك اذا بعبد امير المومنين قد وقف على باب وهو راكب على مطية وعنده منديل فيه حواي ثم قال لقايم الفندق: انزل عندك البارحة رجل يعرف بابن ابي القمر؟
# قال له: انما نزل عندي البارحة رجل مسكين نعرفه في ذالك البيت فدفع عنه الكرا رجل من التجار صدقة عنه لوجه الله تعلى.
# قال: فقصد العبد الى البيت فلما رءاه الوزير فزع منه فزعا شديدا فقال له العبد: لا تخف يا مولاي فقد ادركك رضا مولاي وقد صلب اعداؤك وصح عنده انك على الحق وانهم ادعوا عليك الباطل وبما لم تفعل.
# ثم قال له العبد: يا سيدي اركب هذه المطية والبس هذا الكسوة.
[18.7]
# فقام الوزير من ساعته ولبس الثياب بعدما حمد الله تعلى واثنا عليه بما هو اهله وركب المطية وسار مع العبد حتى قرب من المدينة فاجتاز به العبد على البساتين ورياضات الامير عبد الملك.
# فلما دخل الوزير على الملك قام اليه اجلالا له وعنقه وصفحه وانزل معه وقال: ايها الوزير جميع ما جزت من البساتين والرياضات فاني قد وهبتها لك في حق ما اخطيت عليك وصدقت فيك كلام الناس.
# قال: فاخذ الوزير كلما وهب له الامير واعاده الى منزلته.
[18.8]
# وكان من قضاء الله تعلى ان التاجر صاحب الوزير خرج ذات يوم من الايام في قافلة فبينما هم يسيرون في بعض الطريق اذا خرجت عليهم اللصوص فانزلوهم من اعلى دوابهم وسلبوا كل ما كان بايديهم ولم يبق للتاجر لا قليل ولا كثير فقال التاجر في نفسه: والله لامضي الى المدينة لعلي اجد فيها من يقارضني ولعل الله تعلى يجود علي بما يشاء لاني معروف بالتجارة.
# وهنا ادرك شهرزاد الصبح فسكتت عن الكلام.
### || 18.2 الليلة الحادية والمائة

# [18.9]
# قال فهراس الفيلسوفي:
# قالت: يا مولاي وذلك لما قصد التاجر الى المدينة وهي الشام جاز على تلك
~~البساتين والرياضات التي وهبها الملك للوزير فبينما التاجر حايرا لا يدري
~~ما يصنع ولا اين يتوجه واذا بالوزير خارج من رياضة متوجها الى منزله اذا
~~نظره التاجر فلما قرب اليه عرفه.
[18.10]
# فقال في نفسه: اليس هذا صاحبي الذي فعلت معه كذا وكذا والله لاتعرض اليه
~~فعسى يقبل علي ويحسن الي بشيء.
# قال: فتعرض له التاجر فلم يقبل الوزير عليه ولا عرفه من كثرة الناس ولان
~~الوزير كان متغير الحال والتاجر ايضا كان متعفر الاحوال فقال التاجر في
~~نفسه: انا اعرفه بنفسي لعله يرحمني بشيء.
# فسال عنه بعض الناس فاعلموه انه وزير الملك واعلمه الخبر فاتبعه التاجر
~~حتى عاينه قد دخل منزله فاخذ التاجر قرطاسا وكتب فيه بيتين من الشعر يذكر
~~بهما الوزير مقاله حين بات في بيت الفندق وهما هذه الابيات:
# الا قل للوزير بلا احتشام %~% ما قال مذكرا ما قد نسيه
# تدل وتقول بضيق حال %~% الا موت يباع فاشتريه
[18.11]
# قال: فلما تم كتابة القرطاس دفعه الى غلام الوزير وقال له: ادفع هذا
~~القرطاس الى مولاك.
# فدخل العبد الى سيده ودفع له القرطاس فلما قراه وعرف خبره خرج اليه وصفحه
~~وعنقه وقال له: والله لا دخلت الا على عنق الغلام.
# فادخله وصنع له وليمة عظيمة واعطاه كلما وهب له الملك وجاء به الى الملك
~~وقال له: هذا هو الرجل الذي عرفتك به وقد وهبت له كلما وهبت لي.
# قال: فنزله الامير بمنزلة عظيمة لما فعل من الخير مع وزيره من غير معرفة
~~وقربه الى نفسه الملك وبقا التاجر مع الوزير اخوانا حتى اتاهم اليقين
~~والحمد لله رب العالمين.
