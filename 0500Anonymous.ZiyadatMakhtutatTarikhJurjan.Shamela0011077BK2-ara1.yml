90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text has been tagged, but needs to be reviewed
    and vetted following the new workflow and the missing data to be
    supplied.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH):
    1- Untagged all Juz’
    (which has no effect on the structure of the text).
    Levelling of the headers corrected.
    2- Pages 550 onwards is some extra text on the main manuscript,
    which is not part of this text. This part should be separated.
    I raised an issue for this.
    3- A different edition can be found here:

    PV: the original text file contained the Tārīkh Jurjān,
    followed by additional text and marginal notes
    that were found in the same manuscript but do not belong
    to the Tārīkh Jurjān itself (pages 550ff.).
    PV split the additions off as 0500Anonymous.ZiyadatMakhtutatTarikhJurjan
    See p. 503 in the alternative edition noted by HRH:
    "qāla al-muʾtamin: lammā balagha hunā samiʿtu hādhihi al-ziyādāt
    wa-hiya fī ākhir al-rābiʿ ʿashr min ajzāʾ hādhā al-kitāb
    wa-hiya ijāza li-al-shaykh Abī al-Qāsim al-Sahmī bi-qirāʾat
    Muḥammad b. Aḥmad b. al-Khāḍiba - wa-dhakara jamāʿa ākhirhum
    Ismāʿīl al-Samarqandī - min shawwāl sanat ithnatayn wa-sabʿīn
    wa-arbaʿa miʾa. Ākhirhu, wa-ṣalā Allāh ʿalā Muḥammad wa-ālihi wa-sallam"
    And on p. 517, the editor remarks: "Kitāb Tārīkh Jurjān khutima fī ṣafḥa
    504 - wa-lākin kāna fī al-nuskha al-aṣl ziyādāt mufīda laysat min al-kitāb
    wa-lidhā athbatnāhā fī al-ākhir min ṣafḥat 505 - 517".
