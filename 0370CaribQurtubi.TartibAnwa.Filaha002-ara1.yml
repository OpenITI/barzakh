90#VERS#COMMENT##: Converted from HTML at filaha.org, which is a transcription of the Dozy edition, which in turn is a transcription in Arabic letters of the judaeo-Arabic manuscript. The Dozy edition has the original manuscript readings and Dozy's suggestions for filling in lacunae in the the critical apparatus; the filaha.org transcription moved these into the text, between square brackets. I removed all these square brackets.
