90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes, HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV: the original edition contains two texts
    (see introduction p. 61, and the footnote on p. 454):
    1- an edition of Escorial ms. MDCCXX (currently no. 1725),
    containing the Thabat by Ibn ʿAlī al-Balawī, in 55 folios
    2- an edition of a separate text, Ibn al-Ghāzī's Taʿallul bi-rusum al-isnād,
    extant in three manuscripts
    (base of the edition: Riyad, Royal Library ms 3444; see p. 454, footnote).
    An ijāza for the second text is written in the hand of its author (Ibn al-Ghāzī)
    on the last page of the Thabat manuscript (see p. 450 n. 1),
    which is the reason why Ibn al-Ghāzī's text is included in this edition.
    PV split off the second text
    SPL: Good correspondence; no obvious errors. I have marked
    the main sections, but there are smaller semantic units that could be
    marked (book lists, isnads, etc.), although this might be best done by a
    specialist.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All untagged headers tagged.
    An issue raised for page 453 onwards which is written by a different author.
