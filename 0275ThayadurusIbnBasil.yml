90#AUTH#COMMENT##: Ibn al-Nadīm names a certain Thayādūrus
    as the translator of the text; the Istanbul manuscript
    has Thadhārī b. Basīl Akhī Iṣṭifan, which would 
    identify him as the brother of the more famous 
    translator Iṣṭifan b. Basīl, a collaborator of Ḥunayn
    b. Isḥāq. (see Joep Lameer, al-Fārābī and Aristotelian 
    Syllogistics (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/463881386), 
    pp. 3-5). No information on his date of death is known.
