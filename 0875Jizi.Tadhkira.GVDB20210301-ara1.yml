90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a short text I typed up from a unique manuscript held in the Dar al-Kutub in Egypt (MS Dār al-Kutub Majāmīʿ 391). Nothing is known about its author except the name he provides in this text. The text is dated to the year 866 and dedicated to the Mamluk sultan Khushqadam, so I have accorded the date 875 to the text, until possible further evidence emerges. Version links are from the manuscript description I made for the MMSII Bibliography of Arabic Historiography.
