90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Peter Verkinderen
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Converted from HTML at filaha.org, which is a transcription of manuscript No. 894, King Saud University Library, Riyadh. The transcriber is not named there. Perhaps the transcription is taken from the edition/transcription prepared by Adīb ʿUmar al-Ḥuṣarī (http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48047699), but I have not been able to check this.
