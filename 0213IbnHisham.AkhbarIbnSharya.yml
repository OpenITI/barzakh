90#BOOK#COMMENT##: The authorship of the text is problematic.
    The text was published together with Ibn Hishām's Kitāb al-Tījān
    because it is appended to that text in some (but not all) manuscripts.
    The text starts with a riwāya: "ʿUbayd b. Sharya transmitted to us
    on the authority of al-Barqī, who listed his authorities..."
    Krenkow (Islamic Culture 2.2 (July 1928), p. 235) 
    noted that something is wrong with this riwāya: 
    Ibn Sharya is the ultimate source of all the transmissions in
    the text, al-Barqī could be Abū Saʿd ʿAbd al-Raḥīm b. ʿAbd Allāh al-Barqī,
    a student of Ibn Hishām and "the principal authority for the transmission
    of the Sīrah as revised by Ibn Hishām", or his brother ʿAbd Allāh, 
    who was also a transmitter of the Sīra. Krenkow thinks the text as we have it
    was written by Ibn Isḥāq and redacted by Ibn Hishām.
