90#BOOK#COMMENT##: This text is part of al-Ṣūlī's Kitāb al-Awrāq,
    edited by Hilāl Nājī from the Azhar manuscript no. 487 Khāṣṣ - 7083 Abāẓa Adab;
    the edited fragment covers the years years 295-315AH (folios 1A-162B).
    The years 316-318 (folios 163B-186A from the same manuscript) 
    were edited, also by Hilāl Nājī, already in 1990. Together, these parts
    cover almost all of al-Muqtadir's reign (r. 295-320), and thus
    preceded the Akhbār al-Rāḍī (r. 322-329/934-940)
    wa-al-Muttaqī (r. 329-333/940-944), which had already been edited.
