    NOTE: RisƒÅla no. 2 in the Hyderabad edition; "Note that a fragment of the text
    (corresponding to six pages in the Arabic manuscript Bankipore 2468, namely ff.
    125-130) is missing in this edition, but was printed elsewhere. Thus, on p. 5
    line 10, between (a.haduhA) and (bi-annahA), one should place the text from p.
    34 line 8 (min al-Akhar) until p. 63 line 4 tu.sifa from tract no. 3, "Fi
    harakat al-shams" [On the motions of the sun] in the publication Rasa'ilu ibn-i
    Sinan, by Ibrahim ibn Sinan b. Thabit b. Qurra al-Harrani, Containing Six
    Tracts, Hyderabad: Osmania Oriental Publication Bureau, 1367 H./1948 A.D
    (reprinted in IMA 27). We also note that the pages 212-226 at the end of the
    edition have been wrongly numbered 112-126."
