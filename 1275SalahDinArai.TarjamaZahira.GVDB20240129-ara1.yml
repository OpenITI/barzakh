90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digitised with eScriptorium, post-corrected by Gowaart. 
    The OCR was of very high quality so I have not done a close reading 
    of the digital text beyond the second page.
    This text was originally published as an anonymous text by H.M. Fakhr, 
    which is the edition I have digitised here (see archive.org link).
    Nile Green (Bombay Islam, p. 175) plausibly suggests it was written 
    by the copyist named in the manuscript's colophon, and I have followed
    his assumption here. The original text contained an interlinear 
    translation of the text in Persian, but the languages were separated 
    in their edition (see Fakhr article for details).
