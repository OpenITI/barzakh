90#VERS#COMMENT##: Appears in good order compared to printed edition. Qa'ida's are introduced formulaically with:  al-qa'ida' + ordinal number: e.g., al-thani + phrase in square brackets, e.g., [xxx]. New line: phrase: 'Awalan: lafz wurud al-qa'ida'. New line: the canon itself, sometimes in speech marks, sometimes not. Indexes are included w/ full lists of qa'idas (not every volume, but groups thereof covering multiple volumes and final volume index is missing).
