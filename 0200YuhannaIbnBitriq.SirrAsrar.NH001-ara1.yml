90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text file contains an edition of the 
    Short Form recension in 8 maqālāt ("SF8") of the Sirr al-Asrār.
    The edition was prepared by Neelam Hussain, 
    curator of the Mingana Collection of Middle Eastern Manuscripts, 
    University of Birmingham. The edition was provided to OpenITI
    as a MS Word document. 
    It is based on the 12th/18th C manuscript Paris BnF Arabe 2421 
    (online at https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b11001632n), 
    which the editor collated with another manuscript, 
    Leiden Universiteitsbibliotheek MS Or. 749 
    (10th/17th C, copied in Istanbul; catalogue entry at 
    https://catalogue.leidenuniv.nl/permalink/f/n95gpj/UBL_ALMA71324052910002711). 
    Empty spaces in the Paris ms. (left blank for rubrication?) 
    are filled in from the Leiden ms. and indicated in the original edition 
    as red text between black curly braces; in the OpenITI text,
    those are indicated with pointed brackets ( < > ).
    Alternative text inserted from Leiden 749 is indicated in the
    original edition as blue text between blue curly braces;
    in the OpenITI text, this is indicated with single curly braces ( { } ).
    The editor's own suggestions are indicated in the original edition
    as red text between red curly braces. These have been rendered
    in the OpenITI text as double curly braces ( {{ }} ). 
    In the original edition, the folio page numbers of the Paris ms.
    were inserted at the end of a paragraph, and the location of
    the start of the new folio in the text was indicated with a pipe ( | );
    PV moved the page numbers to their correct location in the text.
    PV also added structural annotation.
    PV copied the images from the edition and added links to them in the text.
    The Paris manuscript contains three separate colophons: 
    one by the translator, Yaḥyā b. al-Biṭrīq;
    one by a copyist, dated Saturday 6 Jumādā II 1119 (3 September 1707), in Fez;
    one by another copyist, dated 25 Shaʿbān 1144 (21 February 1732), in Jerusalem.
    PV marked each colophon with a ### |PARATEXT| tag.
