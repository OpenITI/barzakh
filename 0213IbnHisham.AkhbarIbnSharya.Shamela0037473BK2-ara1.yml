90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original digital text contains two separate books:
    Ibn Hishām's reworking of Wahb b. Munabbih's Kitāb al-Tījān
    (0213IbnHisham.Tijan) and another work (0213IbnHisham.AkhbarIbnSarya),
    containing traditions related by the (possibly fictitious)
    ʿUbayd/ʿAbīd Ibn Sharya al-Juhrumī to the Caliph Muʿāwiya,
    that is appended to the Kitāb al-Tījān in some but not all manuscripts.
    Krenkow (Islamic Culture 2.2 (July 1928), p. 234-236) considers the latter
    a separate work (probably) redacted by Ibn Hishām, although Ibn Hishām is not
    mentioned in the riwāya of the work.
    PV split the original text file into two separate files.
    PV removed the appendix (a quotation from Ibn al-Athīr that 
    is based on the section at the end of the work that is broken off).
