90#AUTH#COMMENT##: "The author Yūsuf ibn Yūsuf al-Maḥallī, as noted by historian David King (1983:45) in his survey of Yemeni astronomical treatises, is surrounded by a certain amount of confusion. This scholar’s name is recorded as Yūsuf ibn Yūsuf al-Maḥallī al-Shāfi‘ī al-Ash‘arī in a copy he made in Ṣan‘ā’ of an earlier 13th century zīj by Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr al-Kawāshī. King suggests that our author is identical to the Egyptian astronomer Yūsuf Kalārjī and that the nisba is in reference to al-Maḥalla in the Nile Delta. If so, he was a student of the Egyptian astronomer Riḍwān Efendī and apparently traveled to Crete and Mecca as well. In the absence of any biographical information from Yemeni sources, I agree with King that al-Maḥallī was no doubt an itinerant Egyptian scholar, who probably arrived in Yemen after the year 1133/1721, when there is the last evidence of work he completed in Egypt. His main extant work in Yemen is dated during the period from 1143-1147 AH with a mark of ownership in his name recorded in a manuscript as late as 1157/1744. In theory it is possible to derive the nisba from a Yemeni origin, although there are no direct references to him in the Yemeni biographical texts. For example, there is a Yemeni village called al-Miḥilla, located about fifteen miles north of the central Yemeni town of Dhamār (Qadi Ismā‘īl al-Akwa‘ 1988:256, note 4). This town receives a mention in Yāqūt’s early 13th century gazetteer and is located near an important center of learning. There is also a village known as al-Maḥalla south of Ibb in Wadi Suḥl (al-Maqḥafī 1985). If our author had been born in Yemen, he may have received his education at the famous Shamsīya madrasa in Dhamār. As Qadi Ismā‘īl al-Akwa‘ (1980:369) laments in his historical treatment of this school, most of the scholars there do not have formal recorded biographies. The evidence suggests, however, that al-Maḥallī was not born and trained in Yemen, but came from Egypt." (http://www.filaha.org/almanac_yusuf_al_mahalli.html)
