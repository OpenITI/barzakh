90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was digitised in two different phases. In 2019 I assembled a digital version of roughly the first half of the diwan, up to poem 60 on page 87, by copying single poems found in the diwan and included on an online poetry website which I can not find again now (it was something like https://poetsgate.com/ but I distinctly remember the layout being different and I think the website name included "adab") and typing the poems that were not included in the database. In 2022 I revived this half-finished project and OCR'd the remaining pages on eScriptorium. I have not closely proofread every line of poetry, but corrected mistakes when I saw them. There are doubtlessly still typos, but in part this is due to the print and scan quality of the edition available to me, which is often unclear or ambiguous. The edition includes an appendix with poetry compiled from various other sources but I have not digitised this, as the diwan did not historically circulate as such.
