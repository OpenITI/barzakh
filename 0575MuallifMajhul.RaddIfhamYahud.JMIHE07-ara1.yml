90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of 7 fragments of a codex in Hebrew letters
    from the Geniza containing sections belonging to a refutation of 
    Samaw'al al-Maghribī (d. 570/1175)'s Ifḥām al-Yahūd 
    by an unidentified Rabbanite Jew. 
    The text was extracted from an xml version of
    Jewish-Muslim Intellectual History Entangled. Textual Materials from the Firkovitch
    Collection, Saint Petersburg, edited by Camilla Adang, Bruno Chiesa,
    Omar Hamdan, Wilferd Madelung, Sabine Schmidtke and Jan Thiele, 
    Open Book Publishers 2020, 373-404 (see pp. 47-52 for an introduction to the edition).
    The pagination of the print version was not represented in the xml file;
    the pagination of the manuscripts  is used instead:
    * PageV0a (ا) refers to St Petersburg, National Library of Russia, ms. YA I 1217, fol. 1.
      (containing only (part of) the ḥamdallah; not included in the edition
      because it is not certain it belongs to the Radd Ifḥām al-Yahūd)
    * PageV0b (ب) refers to St Petersburg, National Library of Russia, ms. YA I 3020.
    * PageV0j (ج) refers to National Library of Russia, ms. YA II 470, fol. 1.
