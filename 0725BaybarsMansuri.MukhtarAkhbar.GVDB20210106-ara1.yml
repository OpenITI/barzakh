90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digitised via Google OCR, cleaned up and annotated by Gowaart using simplified mARkdown. Poetry has been tagged. The edition in fact only includes the final part of the unique manuscript preserving this text (skipping anything pre-Ayyubid), so this is an incomplete text -- the first page of the MS included in the edition shows that the text in fact starts in pre-Islamic times. Page 6 is missing from pdf so has not been digitised. On pp. 88-90 information is in a sort of tabulated form, I have used pipes to separate the items.
