90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is the result of an OCR process with Google Drive, corrected manually. The edition is based on one defective manuscript copy and includes additions from two later authors Nuwayri and Maqrizi who quote the text. These additions are rendered between square brackets. The edition also used round brackets for words and phrases that only appear in the manuscript. I have deleted these latter round brackets to avoid confusion with the square brackets. The variations from the later versions of the text will be easily visible via passim results anyway. The edition also includes a second very short text from the same manuscript (a prose praise of a prominent member of the dynasty), which I have included here as they clearly belong together. The edition additionally includes dozens of excerpts from other sources on the same subject, but I have not digitised these, as they are not directly related to this text.
