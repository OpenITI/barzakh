90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCR on eScriptorium. The text exists in one manuscript, 
    but its publication history is complicated: 
    the first half of it was edited by Axel Moberg in his PhD thesis (see VERS#BASED). 
    The second half, which consists of extensive citation of two waqf documents, 
    was edited in part by the same editor in a separate article 
    (see worldcat link in VERS#COLLATED, VERS#LINKS is to the digitised manuscript), 
    but he omitted large sections of it which he did not think were interesting. 
    I have merged both edited parts and the omitted sections from the manuscript here 
    to better reflect the original text, using PageV01 for the text edition, 
    PageV03 for the article, and PageV02 for the manuscript folios that have not been edited 
    (the first part of which is situated between the two edited parts).
    For PageV01: pages 3 to 48 were OCR'd using arabPersPrBigMixed_best model, 
    the remainder using the much better 12-24-2021_ArabPersGeneralized model, 
    which I also used for PageV02 and PageV03. 
    Postcorrected by Gowaart, but typos undoubtedly remain.  
    I have corrected some of the editions' orthography but not always, 
    so it will be best to take this into account when doing searches on the text. 
    The text edition follows the manuscript by marking rhymed prose with asterisks. 
    I have left this in, as it can be analytically useful and furthermore represents 
    the manuscript transmission of the text. 
    On PageV02P116a 1,5 lines in the manuscript have been blotted out. 
    I have not tried to reconstruct them.
