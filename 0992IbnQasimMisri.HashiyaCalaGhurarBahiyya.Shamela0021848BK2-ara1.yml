    use consistently)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original edition on which this digital text 
    is based (al-Maktaba al-Maymaniyya (?), n.d.) was not found; 
    the edition used for collation (Dār al-Kutub al-ʿIlmiyya, 1997)
    contains a text that consists of 5 layers (see vol. 1, introduction, pp. 3ff.):
    1. 0749ZaynDinIbnWardi.BahjatHawi
    2. 0926ZakariyyaAnsari.GhurarBahiyya: commentary on Ibn al-Wardī's Bahja
    3. 1326CabdRahmanShirbini.HashiyaCalaGhurarBahiyya: ḥāshiya on the Ghurar al-Bahiyya
    4. 0992IbnQasimMisri.HashiyaCalaGhurarBahiyya: ḥāshiya on the Ghurar al-Bahiyya
    5. 1326CabdRahmanShirbini.TaqrirCalaHashiyatIbnQasim: taqrīr on Ibn al-Qāsim's ḥāshiya on the Ghurar al-Bahiyya
    Only (2), (3) and (4) are tagged in the original text file;
    the original edition perhaps contained only those three texts.
    The text was split into its constituent parts using a script.
