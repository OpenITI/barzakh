90#VERS#COMMENT##: Unable to locate printed edition specified in digital file (nor on Worldcat),
    so checked against version published w/ commentary.
    Each section is introduced as follows: ':( المَادَّةُ 2 )', ':( المَادَّةُ 1 )', etc.
    Note: According to Intisar Rabb's bibliography, the first 99 articles contain qāʿidas.
    Each entry - I checked a number from the first 99 appear to correspond accurately
    w/ the printed edition's quotations of the original work.
    (I presume that not all of the following articles are qāʿidas?).
    I have inserted page divisions every 25 entries.
