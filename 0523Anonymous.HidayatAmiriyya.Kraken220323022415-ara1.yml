    NOTE: PDF provided by MB. Although the text is attributed to the Fatimid Caliph
    Amir, it was written by his secretaries, not him. The text contains a letter and
    an appendix containing some responses to the letter sent from dissenters in
    Damascus. Fyzee argues for a range of dates for when the response might have
    been sent, for the date I have adopted the latest option. Although the text is
    said to have been written in this date, as with so many Ismaili texts, it
    survives in six manuscripts of which the earliest is about 100 years old. Fyzee
    collated all six in his preparation of the edited text. Text of the editon is
    found on the pdf pages 3 to 39.
