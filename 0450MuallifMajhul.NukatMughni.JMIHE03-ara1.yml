90#VERS#COMMENT##: Transcription of 18 fragments of a manuscript in Hebrew letters
    from the Geniza containing sections belonging to volumes 1-3 
    of the Karaite recension/abbreviation of Qāḍī ʿAbd al-Jabbār's Kitāb al-Mughnī. 
    These volumes are missing in the extant manuscripts of the Yemeni recension. 
     
    The remainder of the former codex are scattered under four shelfmarks:
    * National Library of Russia, ms. Arab 104 (from which the transcribed sections originate)
    * National Library of Russia, ms. Arab 105 (92 folios)
    * National Library of Russia, ms. AY 381 (one leaf)
    * British Library, ms. OR 2569 (190 folios)
    The text was extracted from an xml version of
    Jewish-Muslim Intellectual History Entangled. Textual Materials from the Firkovitch
    Collection, Saint Petersburg, edited by Camilla Adang, Bruno Chiesa,
    Omar Hamdan, Wilferd Madelung, Sabine Schmidtke and Jan Thiele, Open Book Publishers 2020.
    The pagination of the print version was not represented in the xml file;
    the pagination of the manuscript (ms. Arab 104) is used instead
