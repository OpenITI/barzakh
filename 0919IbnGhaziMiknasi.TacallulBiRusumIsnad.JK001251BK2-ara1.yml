90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV: the original edition contains two texts
    (see introduction p. 61, and the footnote on p. 454):
    1- an edition of Escorial ms. MDCCXX (currently no. 1725),
    containing the Thabat by Ibn ʿAlī al-Balawī, in 55 folios
    2- an edition of a separate text, Ibn al-Ghāzī's Taʿallul bi-rusum al-isnād,
    extant in three manuscripts
    (base of the edition: Riyad, Royal Library ms 3444; see p. 454, footnote).
    An ijāza for the second text is written in the hand of its author (Ibn al-Ghāzī)
    on the last page of the Thabat manuscript (see p. 450 n. 1),
    which is the reason why Ibn al-Ghāzī's text is included in this edition.
    PV split off the second text
