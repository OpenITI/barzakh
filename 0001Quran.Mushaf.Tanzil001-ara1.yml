90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital Quran text, downloaded from the 
    website https://tanzil.net/download/
    (the website offers many different download options - 
    this is the "Simple (clean)" version 
    downloaded as "Text (with aya numbers)", and without pause marks, 
    sajda signs, rub-el-hizb signs and tatweel below superscript alefs).
    PV added mARkdown first-level headers for every sura, with the sura number.
    PV tagged every aya as a separate paragraph. 
    Sura and Aya numbers are indicated on every line: `# <sura_no>|<aya_no>| <aya_text>`.
    The original file did not contain pagination; 
    PV added a dummy page number under every sura
    (with the sura number as page number)
