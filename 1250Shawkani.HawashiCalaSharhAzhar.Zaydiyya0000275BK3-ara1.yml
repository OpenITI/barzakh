90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Zaydiyya0000275 is a digitization of (a pirated edition of?) 
    ʿAlī Yaḥyā al-Yamānī's edition of the Sharḥ al-Azhār (Cairo 1332: Maṭbaʿat Sharikat al-Tamaddun),
    not including its long introduction containing al-Jundārī's Tarājim, nor the footnotes and ḥawāshī. 
    Vol. 3 includes another text related to the Sharḥ al-Azhār, al-Ḥīmī's Tabṣira. 
    PV split off that work into a separate text file.
    PV also removed the ḥawāshī in the footnotes, which, according to the title page,
    came from a manuscript (dated 1207 AH) that was copied (including the ḥawāshī) 
    from a manuscript of and read to Shaykh al-Islām al-qāḍī al-ʿallāma 
    Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Shawkānī.
