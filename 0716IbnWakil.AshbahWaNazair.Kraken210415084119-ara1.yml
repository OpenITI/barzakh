90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken:
    * segmentation model: DEFAULT
    * OCR model: arabPers-WithDiffTypefaces.mlmodel€î The text and collated is based on the Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya edition from 2002. Unusually, there is no Worldcat record of this. Pagination is out by -2. There is not a consistent way to introduce a qa'ida. Qa'ida's are in separate sections, but each section may contain several qa'ida's. They are not introduced uniformly. Sometimes the qaida immediately follows the title on the next line (e.g., pg. 166; 164 in digital text). Other times it will be embedded further in the paragraph. If there are a series of qa'ida's these might be introduced with numbered entries, e.g, ahadun minha.
