    This text did not OCR particularly well.
    It would take a long time to correct all of the errors;
    there are numerous parts w/ jumbled text and lines.
    I did not attempt to correct this.
    However, the qawāʿid are in good order and very formulaic,
    so I concentrated and verified these.
    Each qawaid is as follows, from right to left, including brackets: (qawaid text) || ###
