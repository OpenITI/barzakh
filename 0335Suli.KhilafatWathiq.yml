90#BOOK#COMMENT##: A fragment of al-Ṣūlī's unfinished work that 
    is referred to as Kitāb al-Awrāq. This fragment covers
    the caliphates of al-Wāthiq (r. 227-232),
    al-Mutawakkil (r. 232-247), al-Muntaṣir (r. 247-248), 
    al-Mustaʿīn (r. 248-252), al-Muʿtazz (r. 252-255) and al-Muhtadī (r. 255-256).
    This manuscript was edited by Kratchkovsky's student Belyaev (d. 1976)
    but never published; finally, Belyaev's student Anas Khalidov published it,
    with a Russian translation, in 1993.
